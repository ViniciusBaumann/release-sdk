## [Unreleased]

## [0.29.0] — 2026-09-22

Driven by a 45-day measurement of hubus: phase time was maker churn (1,534 pytest runs, 34% red,
148 ritual RED commits), tests enshrined the implementation (49 asserts locked the phase-133 stub)
and the root gate had degraded into a hand whitelist with no broad suite.

### Added
- `/release:statusline` + `bin/release-statusline.js`: Claude Code status bar with model/effort,
  project, branch, live phase/task from `.release-planning/`, context bar, cost, 5h/7d limits, cache.
- `release_gate_audit` in `release-gate-lib.sh`: `GATE_WARN=` lines (`no-broad-step`,
  `no-focused-step`, `create-db`, `phase-local-gate`) printed by every `run_gate`; execute/quick
  copy them into the report.
- `tdd-executor` `<test_oracle>`: expected values come from the AC/R-XX text, never from running the
  code; a constant where the AC says computed is hollow; hard cap of 8 test runs per task
  (`test_runs` in the ledger).
- `phase-verifier` hollow check for tests that enshrine a constant; the expected observable of each
  AC is written from the SPEC before the tests are read.
- `django-validate-commit.sh` blocks separate `test: RED` / `reproduce` commits.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** quick gate default runs `pytest {focused}` (and `vitest run {focused}` when vitest is
  present) after lint/migrations; a quick no longer lands on lint alone.
- Django default gate gains a `test-focused: pytest {focused}` step before the broad suite.
- `/release:quick` escalates to `--strict` above 10 production files or 400 production lines.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-09-22

Driven by the hubus 133 / moblity-app 32 post-mortem: a C4 phase landed with the live half of its
canonical wire stubbed (`fonte="horario"`, `eta_minutos=0`), a checker verdict of "PASS with declared
pending", 1 of 20 decisions made by the user, and an app that then hid live ETAs. Every item below
closes one mechanism that allowed it.

### Added
- `bin/release-spec-lint.js` + `test-spec-lint.sh`: every D-XX carries an origin (`USER` | `LOCK` |
  `CODE:<file:line>` | `INFERRED`); `status: ready` forbids `INFERRED`; C2+ requires `## Domain rules`
  with `R-XX [USER, kind]` (C2 ≥3, C3/C4 ≥5; ≥1 `invariant`, C3/C4 ≥1 `degraded`) and a non-empty
  `## Out of scope`. `/release:spec` and the `/release:plan` preflight ask the domain rules first
  and confirm every inferred decision in one batch before `ready`.
- `[external-evidence: ...]` AC marker (spec time only): the only way an acceptance criterion may stay
  open; the verifier reports it as `EXTERNAL`, never PASS.
- `release_effective_maturity <root> [phase_dir]`: most restrictive maturity across this repo, the
  SPEC and the paired repo — a wire/compat decision follows the consumer's maturity.
- `{focused}` in `VERIFY-GATE.yml`: test targets implied by the diff against the base
  (`release_focused_test_targets`, `.release-planning/.gate-base`); no targets ⇒ `SKIPPED_NO_TARGETS`.
  Template gate now has `test-focused` / `test-full` / `test-serial` lanes.
- `release_execenv_worktree_safe`, `release_execenv_worktree_path`, `release_execenv_runner_path` and
  the `test_root_in_runner` EXEC-ENV key: `/release:quick` places its worktree INSIDE the mounted
  root and the runner tests the unit's own code; a runner that cannot see a worktree is a hard stop.
- `release_worker_model [C0-C4]`: C3/C4/strict makers floor at opus in both profiles.

### Changed
- `release:phase-verifier` / `loop-goal-verifier`: verdict is the literal `PASS` or `GAPS`; a
  half-met AC is GAPS; hollow implementations (constant wire values, dead aliases, self-referential
  tests, parallel engines) are `HOLLOW:` gaps; plan drift (approach the task did not name, files
  outside `files:`) is `DRIFT:`.
- `release:tdd-executor` / `code-fixer`: per-task clause ledger; `plan_conflict`,
  `needs_scope_reduction` and `USER_INPUT_REQUIRED` are hard stops; SPEC/PLAN/CONTRACT are read-only
  during execute (`.contract-sha` checked before land); compat layers only from a D-XX naming the
  protected consumer with `file:line`.
- `release-plan-lint.js`: `verification:` must name a test file or node id; with an Acceptance
  mapping, every AC needs a task that claims it in `acceptance:` and names a test.
- `feature-planner` / `plan-checker`: coverage by named test on the production path; joins between
  existing engines are their own task; no AC clause deferred to a "next slice".

## [0.27.0] — 2026-09-09

Driven by an audit of 139 real sessions (hubus + moblity-app, 2026-08-10 → 2026-09-09): the SDK
was used mostly through `quick` and freeform sessions, `session` was never used, and the recurring
friction was operational — "did you push?", "status?", an executor touching prod, worktree sprawl,
the same bug debugged in six fresh sessions, and a token tracker that had stopped recording.

### Removed — BREAKING

- `/release:session` and `/release:workstreams` (and `templates/WORKSTREAM-STATE.md`). Cross-terminal
  orchestration is done natively by Claude Code sessions; the SDK no longer models it. `session/*` is
  no longer a landable branch pattern and `land_branch` no longer returns `badbase`.
- `bin/test-session-merge.sh` → `bin/test-merge-lib.sh` (same engine coverage, session shims replaced by
  generic `feat/<label>` units; +13 assertions for the post-land contract).

### Added

- **Post-land contract** (`bin/release-merge-lib.sh`): `release_project_setting`, `release_push_policy`
  (`never|ask|auto` from PROJECT.md → Delivery settings, default `never`), `land_push`, `land_report`.
  `quick`, `execute` and `land` end with exactly one fixed line
  `LAND: merged <base>@<sha> · PUSH: <state> · UNIT: <state>`; `--push` on all three.
- **`/release:land --build` / `--cross`**: release build (`build_command`, default EAS iOS auto-submit
  when `eas.json` exists) after a successful push; paired-phase landing provider-first with
  `deploy_check` wait. `/release:spec --paired <repo>:<NN>` records the pair in both repos' STATE/SPEC.
- **Prod guard** (`hooks/release-prod-guard.js`, PreToolUse Bash, Claude + Codex): blocks
  ssh/scp/remote rsync/remote psql/dokploy/kubectl/remote docker/`*_ENV=prod`/`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=*prod`/
  PaaS shells/`gh workflow run`/`eas submit` while an SDK unit is active (`.release-planning/.unit-active`,
  cwd under `release-worktrees/`, or a `.progress.json` younger than 2 h); warns only outside a unit.
  Released by `--allow-prod` (writes `.allow-prod`), `#allow-prod`, `RELEASE_ALLOW_PROD=1` or
  `PROD-GUARD.yml` (`mode`, `pattern`, `allow`). `bin/test-prod-guard.sh` (26 assertions).
- **`/release:gc`** + `bin/release-gc-lib.sh` (`gc_scan`, `gc_apply`, `gc_count`, `gc_hint_count`):
  prunes worktrees whose branch is on base and whose tree is clean (unlocking SDK locks first),
  vanished worktree registrations, merged branches checked out nowhere, and dead merge locks; keeps
  dirty, unmerged, external (outside `<main_root>/..`), protected and base. Dry run by default.
  SessionStart hook prints a hint when the cheap upper bound is ≥3. `bin/test-gc-lib.sh` (44).
- **Live progress**: `release:tdd-executor` takes `phase_dir` and writes `.progress.json` after every
  task (plain-language note); `execute` prints one product-language line per change (Monitor when
  available) and fires `PushNotification` on land/fail. STATE notes capped at 240 chars, no hashes.
- **Resumable debug**: `/release:debug` greps open sessions for the prompt's significant terms and
  offers to resume the matching one (ruled-out hypotheses are never retested).
- **`maturity: pre-launch`** (PROJECT.md Delivery settings, mirrored into SPEC frontmatter):
  spec/plan/feature-planner/tdd-executor/quick replace and delete instead of adding compatibility
  layers, rollout flags or reversible-migration ceremony. Security/tenancy/data-loss floors unchanged.
- **Token tracker resilience**: the collector spools events to `~/.claude/token-tracker/spool.jsonl`
  when the worker is down; the worker ingests the spool (dedupe by uuid) on start; the SessionStart
  hook starts the worker when port 47777 is closed (`RELEASE_TOKEN_AUTOSTART=0` opts out).
  `bin/test-token-worker.sh` +5 assertions.

### Changed

- `/release:auto` routes "push / build / cross-repo publish" to `land` and "prune / clean worktrees"
  to `gc`; the `session` route is gone.
- `/release:status` writes for the product owner (what works, what is pending, what is external) and
  reprints the last `land_report` line unchanged.
- `templates/PROJECT.md` gains a **Delivery settings** block (`maturity`, `push_after_land`,
  `build_command`, `deploy_check`); `templates/SPEC.md` gains optional `maturity` / `paired`.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-08-27

### Changed — explicit, reusable test harnesses

- Plans now declare `harness_scope`, and phase-specific execution owns local
  `EXEC-ENV.yml` and `VERIFY-GATE.yml` contracts instead of embedding ad hoc runners.
- Managed test environments are stable for the phase, reuse provisioned databases by
  default, and receive the same execution prefix across workers and resumed shells.
- Gate steps are observable and time-bounded, and successful steps are cached while the
  tree and execution-environment fingerprint remain unchanged.
- Ambiguous legacy harness configurations are rejected instead of silently mixing SDK
  provisioning with project-specific test runners.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-08-27

### Changed — adaptive token-economy workflow

- `spec` now owns scope, acceptance and decisions in one compact artifact; `discuss` is a resume/
  amendment path instead of a second discovery pipeline.
- `plan` uses one planner and deterministic structural lint by default. Research, pattern mapping and
  an LLM checker are conditional on C3/C4 risk. New fullstack plans use one file.
- `quick` and `execute` are single-pass by default, run focused tests plus one cached gate, and avoid
  test-agent fleets. Parallel waves require at least three independent, file-disjoint strict tasks.
- `loop` is explicit, delta-only, capped at 1/2/3 correction rounds by complexity and USD 5 by default.
- Claude defaults to the cost-safe `opus-sonnet` profile, proportional effort and worker-tier C0–C2
  checking. Codex uses compact runtime contracts, smaller output budgets and Terra/medium for normal
  planning/coordination.
- Five edit hooks were consolidated into `release-edit-guard.js`; per-read scanning and the per-tool
  context-monitor process left the hot path. Token collection now advances by byte offset rather than
  reparsing a 256 KiB tail.
- Added shared economy policy, deterministic PLAN lint, cached GREEN gates and conservative pricing
  fallbacks for new Opus/Fable model IDs.
- Token telemetry now attributes workflow, child agent, phase, C0–C4 complexity and mode, and records
  per-event latency, spawn count and gate executions. The dashboard and `--stats-file` aggregation
  expose those dimensions while retaining the old `skill` field.
- Stack experts were reduced to compact opt-in entry points with progressive references. Routine
  workflow execution no longer loads a second expert persona automatically.
- `verify` consumes the shared committed-tree gate cache and runs cross-phase integration only with
  `--integration`. `review` uses one unified fullstack reviewer by default and splits only in strict
  C3/C4 scopes with disjoint files.
- AI/UI contracts are inline for established C1/C2 patterns. Framework comparison, external
  research and strict UI checking are opt-in or limited to unresolved C3/C4 decisions.
- `session` now loads one subcommand reference instead of a multi-thousand-word embedded shell
  manual; deprecated `workstreams` is a short compatibility alias. Seven inactive legacy hooks and
  eleven duplicated agent-policy blocks were removed from source and generated packages.

## [0.24.1] — 2026-08-11

Fixes from an independent adversarial audit of v0.22.0..v0.24.0. The transversal finding: the suites
run under `bash`, but the harness SOURCES these libs under **zsh** on macOS — two shipped bugs were
invisible to every existing test.

### Fixed — BLOCKER: the baseline turned every inherited red into a RED gate under zsh

- `baseline_parse_failures` used `local id err` (declaration without assignment), which in zsh
  PRINTS the previous values. From the second failure onward the parser emitted `id=…` / `err=…`
  lines as bogus signatures: one inherited failure worked, two or more forced `GATE=RED` — the exact
  many-inherited-reds scenario the feature exists for. Parser rewritten in awk; every `local` in the
  lib declared once, with an assignment.
- Same family, found by the new suite: `run_gate` located its sibling baseline lib via
  `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`, which does not exist in zsh, so `PASS_BASELINE` could never fire there. The
  lib dir is captured at source time from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` (`RELEASE_LIB_DIR` overrides).
- **New `bin/test-zsh-compat.sh`** (46 assertions): every stdout-contract function — baseline, gate,
  loop, model, execenv, progress, planning-sync round trip, `land_branch` — runs in BOTH shells and
  must produce byte-identical output with no leaked locals. Every existing suite also resolves its
  own path with `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` so it can be invoked with `zsh` as well.
  `bin/test-session-merge.sh` remains a bash-only harness (bash arrays throughout); the merge lib
  itself is covered in both shells by the probes above.

### Fixed — BLOCKER-adjacent: the planning sync was also broken under zsh

Found by running the suites under zsh for the first time. `planning_sync_in` iterated a shell glob
(`phases/12-*`), and an unmatched glob is an **error** in zsh (nomatch) — the loop aborted and the
phase worktree was born WITHOUT its PLAN, which is the exact failure the lib exists to prevent.
`planning_sync_out` then dropped every phase-scoped artifact because `case "$dir" in $glob)` does
not re-parse an unquoted variable as a pattern in zsh (bash does). Both now match with `find` plus
an exact-membership test. The cross-shell suite covers a full round trip (in → produce → out).

### Fixed — HIGH

- **Slot lifecycle vs the scheduler.** The harvest step tore down the env and worktree while the
  slot section said slots live to end-of-phase; nothing defined when a slot becomes free; the merge
  recipe named a per-task branch that does not exist in slot mode; `SCHED_CAP` was used before the
  step that defines it. A slot released before its cherry-pick would be `reset --hard` by the next
  task — silent commit loss. REUSE MODE is now an explicit scheduler branch with a stated
  lifecycle (acquire → spawn → pick from the SLOT branch → verify → release), teardown at
  end-of-phase only, and five NEVER rules.
- **Baseline suite key.** `run_gate` looks up by VERIFY-GATE STEP NAME, but every example used stack
  labels (`backend`) — capturing by example produced a file that could never match, leaving the
  feature silently inert. Examples corrected, rule stated in three places, `capture` verifies keys.
- **Hostile test ids.** The recorded-signature reader split on commas (dropping `test_x[1,2]`) and
  the parser truncated at the first ` - ` (mangling `test_x[a - b]`). Both are now bracket- and
  quote-aware.
- **Progress was invisible while it mattered.** The writer lives in the worktree, the reader in the
  main checkout, and the sync only ran at the end — so the 30-minute heartbeat could never be seen
  during a build. `RELEASE_PROGRESS_MIRROR` mirrors every write into the main checkout atomically.
- **`tac` does not exist on macOS.** The wave cherry-pick loop piped `git log` through it, so the
  loop body never ran and the wave's commits were dropped before the worktree was removed — with no
  error. Replaced with `git log --reverse`.

### Fixed — MED

- A bare-assert failure (`- assert 1 == 2`) embeds a volatile repr, so it normalizes to `Failure`
  instead of a signature that can never match twice.
- `run_gate` detects the runner from the OUTPUT, not the step name — a step called `tests` matched a
  naive `*ts*` rule and was parsed as vitest.
- `test_env_migrate` under reuse is now actually wireable: `env_label` + `cfg_root` are part of the
  spawn config (the executor referenced variables nobody passed).
- `run_test_bounded` echoes `TEST_BOUNDED=true|false` (no timeout binary ⇒ the run was NOT bounded,
  and the JSON must not claim otherwise), and rc 137 is reported as ambiguous — SIGKILL is also what
  an OOM kill looks like.
- A task with no `files:` declaration has an unknown footprint: it collides with everything and runs
  alone. Under PARTIAL `depends_on` adoption an undeclared task inherits the wave barrier instead of
  being treated as ready at t=0.
- The cherry-pick conflict fallback re-applies the resume skip filter, so already-landed tasks are
  not executed twice.
- **Trap semantics**: each ```bash block in a skill is its own shell, so `trap … EXIT` fires at the
  end of that block (it would have deleted the worktree it just created) and `trap - EXIT` later is
  a no-op. Replaced by an explicit per-stage Cleanup contract, plus a note to re-export
  `RELEASE_EXEC_PREFIX` in every block that calls `run_gate`.
- The EXEC-ENV header showed a multi-line example the one-line parser silently drops.

### Fixed — LOW

- A value with a leading zero (`phase=07`) was emitted as a bare number, which is invalid JSON — it
  now stays a string. `progress_heartbeat` can actually report `HEARTBEAT=failed`.
- `feature-planner` now EMITS `execution_order:` in fullstack manifests — `/release:execute
  --fullstack` reads it, but nothing produced it.

### Note — behaviour change carried over from 0.23.0

A repo with **no** `EXEC-ENV.yml` now gets a concurrency cap of `min(8, cores/2)` where task spawns
were previously unbounded. Set `test_env_max_parallel` to override.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-08-11

Everything in this release comes from measured friction in one real fullstack phase, not from
speculation.

### Added — `/release:execute --fullstack`: both legs, one worktree, one land

A fullstack phase needed two invocations, each with its own worktree, lock, loop and land, with a
human sequencing them. `--fullstack` creates the lock, worktree, exec-env, loop and land ONCE and
runs the two `wave-executor` legs back-to-back on the same branch, ordered by the manifests'
`execution_order:`. Leg 2 starts only after leg 1's commits are on the branch; a failing leg 1 lands
nothing. One gate run and one `phase-verifier` run cover the union (`stack: fullstack`) — a verified
backend over an unverified frontend is not a phase. `--backend` / `--frontend` unchanged.

### Added — planning artifacts travel with the phase worktree

`.release-planning/` is untracked and `git worktree add` materializes only tracked files, so a phase
worktree was born WITHOUT its PLAN, and the SUMMARY/VERIFICATION it produced lived only inside a
worktree that `land_branch` and the EXIT trap both delete. A real run lost its SUMMARY that way.

- **`bin/release-planning-sync-lib.sh`** (+ 37-assertion test): inputs copied in at setup, produced
  artifacts copied back before any teardown. Deliberately asymmetric — IN overwrites freely, OUT is
  additive-only and never copies scratch (`PLAN-SLICE-*`, `.exec-start-sha`, `sweep-B*.json`).
- A failed copy-back clears the EXIT trap and **aborts the teardown**: leaving a worktree behind is
  always cheaper than losing the artifacts.

### Added — persistent test-failure baseline (`/release:baseline`)

A repo carrying long-standing failures can never reach `GATE=GREEN`, so the loop burns iterations on
code the phase never touched and a real regression hides in the noise.

- **`bin/release-baseline-lib.sh`** (+ 35-assertion test): `.release-planning/test-baselines.json`
  records `<test id>|<error type>` signatures. The error type is part of the signature so the same
  test failing for a **different** reason is NEW — that is how a fresh bug hides behind an old red.
- `run_gate` gains **`PASS_BASELINE`**: a step whose failures are ALL known does not turn the gate
  RED but is echoed for audit (+7 gate assertions). `test-runner` classifies each failure
  BASELINE/NEW; `phase-verifier` never counts an inherited failure as a phase gap; `tdd-executor`'s
  RED proof must be a NEW failure.
- Fail-safe everywhere: no file, unparseable output, or one unknown failure ⇒ everything NEW.

### Added — bounded test runs, hang detection, and a migration hook

- `run_test_bounded` applies `test_timeout` (EXEC-ENV, default 900s) with `timeout -k 10` and echoes
  `TEST_HUNG` / `TEST_ELAPSED` / `TEST_RC` / `TEST_CMD`, output captured to a FILE so it survives the
  caller's `$( )` subshell. `test-runner` retries a hang twice then reports `hung: true` with the
  exact command. A hang is not a test failure — never baseline-classified, never fabricated as one.
- **`test_env_migrate`** — a task that CREATED a migration applies it before its tests. `--reuse-db`
  does not, and in a containerized env it must hit that env's DB clone.

### Added — observable progress + 30-minute heartbeat

**`bin/release-progress-lib.sh`** (+ 43-assertion test) maintains `.progress.json` per phase with
current wave/task, tasks done/total, in-flight ids, active envs and last commit. Writes are atomic
(temp file in the same dir + rename). Values are sanitized rather than backslash-escaped because the
merge loop re-encodes on every write — escaping doubled each time until the file exploded (caught in
test at 32MB). `wave-executor` writes on every dispatch/land/checkpoint, `tdd-executor` heartbeats
before anything slow, and `/release:status` reads it first, flagging a build silent for 30+ minutes.

### Added — opt-in env slots (`test_env_reuse`)

Provisioning costs ~60s, paid per task. With reuse on, `SCHED_CAP` envs are provisioned once per
phase. Slots, not a rebinding pool: bind mounts are fixed at container creation, so the slot owns a
stable worktree path and the task's worktree is reset in place. Trade-off stated, not hidden — a
reused env carries the previous task's schema, so the migrate hook becomes mandatory under it.
Unset ⇒ per-task provision/teardown, fully isolated, unchanged.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-08-11

### Changed — the wave barrier is gone: wave-executor schedules by task readiness

Field evidence from a phase running under the earlier 0.22.0 work: fan-out happened, but observed
concurrency stalled at **2** on a 16-core machine with a cap of 4-6. Three structural ceilings, none
of them the cap: the DAG was wave-granular *with a barrier* (a whole wave waited on the previous
one, ready tasks idling), plans emitted terminal REFACTOR/SECURITY/VERIFY waves spanning every file
of the phase (`parallel_safe: false` by construction — ~40% of wall-clock, and largely redundant
with the per-task RED→GREEN+REFACTOR→SECURITY the executor already runs), and fan-out inside a wave
was opt-in.

- **`agents/feature-planner.md`** — tasks declare `depends_on: [T-IDs]` (real data/contract
  dependencies, `[]` when none); the manifest carries `task_deps`, `critical_path`,
  `critical_path_length`. Explicit non-dependencies documented: wave order, file collisions (the
  executor serializes those dynamically), declaration order. Terminal REFACTOR/SECURITY waves now
  require a cross-cutting justification in their `action:` — task-scoped work belongs to the task.
  Minimizing the critical path is a stated planning goal.
- **`agents/wave-executor.md`** — new `build_readiness_graph` + `readiness_scheduler`: dispatch any
  task whose deps are **committed on the phase branch** and whose files are disjoint from the tasks
  *currently in flight* (dynamic check, not a precomputed per-wave partition), up to the cap;
  harvest the FIRST completion rather than a batch. Cherry-picks stay serialized and in dependency
  order — the scheduler parallelizes making, never landing. A wave checkpoint runs when its tasks
  have landed and does NOT block ready downstream tasks; on failure it freezes dispatch, drains
  in-flight work, then resumes. No ready task with nothing in flight ⇒ dependency cycle ⇒ abort
  naming the ids.
- **`bin/release-execenv-lib.sh`** — `release_default_max_parallel` = `min(8, max(1, cores/2))`
  replaces the flat 4, and `release_sched_max_parallel` bounds concurrent task spawns even with no
  `EXEC-ENV.yml` (previously unlimited). Explicit `test_env_max_parallel` always wins; `0`
  (unlimited envs) is not read as unlimited agents. `RELEASE_EXEC_CORES` overrides detection.
  `test-execenv-lib.sh`: 40 → 53 assertions.
- **`agents/plan-checker.md`** — `task_dependency_audit`: no deps anywhere → MED
  (`NO_TASK_DEPS_WAVE_BARRIER`); partial adoption / manifest-body disagreement → HIGH; **cycle or
  dangling T-id → BLOCKER**. Advisory MEDs for a file collision encoded as a dependency, a
  serial-tail wave, and a critical path covering ≥80% of the phase. Reports `scheduler_shape`
  (depth, width, max theoretical concurrency).
- **Telemetry** — WAVE-SUMMARY.md gains `scheduler`, `sched_cap` and a `parallelism` block
  (max/avg concurrent, critical path + wall, total task time, speedup, `idle_blocked` seconds).

Backwards compatible: a PLAN with no task deps runs the old wave-barrier path and records
`scheduler: wave-barrier` so the lost parallelism is attributed to the plan, not the executor.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-08-11

### Added — per-worktree test environments: parallelism for containerized suites

`/release:execute` fans tasks out into one git worktree per task, but that only works if a task's
tests can run inside that worktree. In a project whose suite runs inside a container mounting ONE
checkout (and one database), sub-worktree code is invisible to it — so every wave collapsed to
serial, which is where multi-hour phases come from (measured: 35 backend tasks ≈ 7h, ~12 min/task).

- **`bin/release-execenv-lib.sh`** — new engine resolving `.release-planning/EXEC-ENV.yml`
  (`test_env_provision` / `test_env_teardown` / `test_exec_prefix` / `test_env_max_parallel`) with
  `{worktree}` / `{label}` / `{root}` placeholders. Labels are sanitized to `[a-z0-9_]`, ≤32 chars,
  never digit-initial — valid as both a container-name suffix and a Postgres database name.
  Provision/teardown run under `RELEASE_EXECENV_TIMEOUT` (default 600s); `RELEASE_EXECENV_DISABLE=1`
  is the kill switch. House style: every function echoes its verdict and returns 0.
- **`bin/test-execenv-lib.sh`** — 40-assertion contract test that SOURCES the real engine.
- **`agents/wave-executor.md`** — provisions one env per parallel sub-worktree, batched at
  `test_env_max_parallel` (default 4, `0` = unlimited), hands each `tdd-executor` spawn its
  `test_exec_prefix`, and tears the env down *before* removing the worktree. A failed provision
  surfaces its evidence file and falls back to serial for that task (`env_provision_failed` in
  WAVE-SUMMARY.md); a failed teardown is logged, never fatal.
- **`skills/execute/SKILL.md`** — provisions the phase worktree's env, tears it down on every exit
  path, and exports `$RELEASE_EXEC_PREFIX` so `VERIFY-GATE.yml` commands run in the same env.
- **`agents/test-runner.md` / `agents/test-discover.md`** — accept `test_exec_prefix` (collection
  imports the app, so `--collect-only` needs the env exactly as execution does).
- **`templates/EXEC-ENV.yml`** — documented contract + Docker and per-worktree-venv examples.

Opt-in by construction: with no `EXEC-ENV.yml` the whole feature is inert and execution behaves
exactly as in 0.21.0 (host-local exec, serial-on-collision).

### Changed — per-task test invocations capped at 2 (was 3-5)

Booting the runner, not running the assertions, is the per-task cost that dominates: a containerized
Django suite pays 30-60s of setup *per invocation*, and each task was paying it 3-5 times
(RED, GREEN, REFACTOR, SECURITY).

- **New `test_invocation_budget` step in `agents/tdd-executor.md`**: RED runs ONLY the task's test
  files (mandatory, still its own commit); GREEN and REFACTOR share ONE combined run — the Author
  Checklist optimizations (Q1-Q7 / RC1-RC7) are applied as part of the implementation edit and then
  verified once, together with lint on the touched files; SECURITY runs only its own file. Budget:
  ≤2 runner invocations per task, ≤3 for the security task, extra runs only to diagnose a real
  failure. Reported as `test_runs:` in SUMMARY.md.
- A separate `refactor(...)` commit is now emitted only when a genuinely separate second pass
  happened; otherwise the applied checklist IDs are recorded in the `feat(...)` commit body.
- `makemigrations --check --dry-run` and `tsc --noEmit` moved to the wave boundary (in-task only
  when the task itself touched models or a shared type contract).
- `skip_sweep` now defaults to **true** for any per-task spawn (`task_filter` or `is_slice` set) —
  a task never owns the suite sweep; the wave boundary and the terminal sweep do.

TDD discipline is unchanged: the RED proof is still mandatory and never merged into another run.
What changed is the *scope and count* of the runs.

### Added — per-task model tier by complexity

`release_worker_model()` handed ONE tier to every `tdd-executor` spawn of a phase, so wiring a
serializer cost the same as writing a concurrency guard.

- **`release_worker_model_for <complexity>`** in `bin/release-model-lib.sh`: `complex`/`standard`/
  unknown/absent → `release_worker_model` (unchanged); `simple` → one rung below the worker with a
  **hard floor at sonnet** (haiku stays reserved for mechanical/collection agents, never for code).
  **Demote-only** — the worker tier is the ceiling; a PLAN cannot promote itself past the tier
  `/release:execute` handed down. `test-model-lib.sh`: 23 → 38 assertions.
- **`agents/feature-planner.md`** — new required `complexity: simple|standard|complex` per task plus
  a `<task_complexity>` criteria table (simple = mechanical 1:1 pattern change, no design decision,
  ≤2 files, RED test is a copy · complex = new algorithm, data-backfill migration, concurrency,
  new security surface, cross-app refactor, RED test needing domain reasoning · standard = the rest
  and the default). Security/race/memray tasks may never be `simple`. The wave manifest repeats the
  labels so the executor routes without opening every slice.
- **`agents/wave-executor.md`** — resolves each spawn's `model:` through `release_worker_model_for`,
  forces risky task types back to `standard`, records `model_mix` + `complexity_mix`.
- **`agents/tdd-executor.md`** — accepts `complexity`, reports `model_mix` and
  `complexity_misclassified`, and must not lower rigor because a task was labelled `simple`.
- **`skills/auto/SKILL.md` (LOCKED doctrine) + `skills/execute/SKILL.md`** — `$WORKER_MODEL` is
  documented as a ceiling; `code-fixer` is explicitly exempt (a fix is diagnosis on evidence the
  maker already failed) and `phase-verifier` stays on the checker tier.
- **Codex parity** — `codex/contracts/routing-policy.md` + `codex/build_plugin.py`:
  `AGENT_MODEL_OVERRIDES` is the ceiling a label may only demote from, and `tdd-executor`'s Terra
  pin is already the code floor, so the label is telemetry-only under Codex.

A PLAN with no `complexity:` field routes every task at the worker tier — identical to 0.21.0.

### Changed — plan-checker FAILs on a missing or invalid `complexity:` label

The label was a planner success-criterion with nothing enforcing it, so a planner under context
pressure could silently drop the judgement and every task would quietly route at the phase worker
tier — a cost surprise discovered only after execute.

- **`agents/plan-checker.md`** — new `complexity_label_audit` step, run before the stack gates:
  a task with no `complexity:` or a value outside `simple|standard|complex` is a **BLOCKER**; a
  `security`/`race`/`memray` task labelled `simple` is a **BLOCKER**; a manifest map that disagrees
  with a task body is HIGH; a missing manifest map or an all-`simple` phase with ≥5 tasks is MED.
  PLAN-CHECK.md gains `complexity_label_violations`, `complexity_mix`, `legacy_plan_no_complexity`
  and a Complexity Labels table showing the routing effect.
- **Retro-compatibility:** a pre-0.22.0 PLAN (NO task carries the key) produces ONE MED
  `LEGACY_PLAN_NO_COMPLEXITY` finding and never FAILs. *Partial* adoption — some tasks labelled,
  some not — is exactly the drift the gate exists for and does FAIL. Already-executed phases are
  never re-checked: plan-check runs only before `/release:execute`.
- The checker never invents a label for an unlabelled task — it is read-only; assigning it is the
  planner's job.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-08-10

### Added — Codex token-economy policy: per-agent model routing, mandatory AGENTS.md gate, generic role catalog

The Codex compatibility layer previously inherited whatever model tier the parent Codex session
was running and never required an `AGENTS.md`. This closes both gaps against the release-sdk Codex
token-economy policy (spawn only when it earns its cost, cheapest sufficient model per role,
structured output instead of raw transcripts, mandatory project instructions before any write).

- **Per-agent model routing** — every generated `release-*.toml` now carries a pinned `model` /
  `reasoning_effort` / `output_token_budget` / `role_class`, hand-classified per agent in
  `codex/build_plugin.py`'s `AGENT_MODEL_OVERRIDES` across three tiers (`gpt-5.6-luna` mechanical,
  `gpt-5.6-terra` everyday, `gpt-5.6` frontier/security/planning). Deliberately breaks the prior
  "never pin a model" invariant.
- **12 generic Codex-only roles** (`release-explorer-fast`, `release-explorer-deep`,
  `release-planner`, `release-worker-lite/-worker/-worker-complex`, `release-tester`,
  `release-reviewer`, `release-security-reviewer`, `release-docs-researcher`,
  `release-handoff-writer`, `release-agents-md-builder`) from new `codex/contracts/roles/*.md`
  sources, for ad-hoc work with no matching specialized `release-*` agent.
- **`release-agents-md-guard.js`** — new blocking `PreToolUse` hook (`exit 2`, following the
  `django-validate-commit.sh` precedent) that refuses Edit/Write/apply_patch in any target project
  missing a root `AGENTS.md`, except the write that creates it. Mode (`strict`/`bootstrap`) read
  from the target project's `.codex/config.toml`.
- **`templates/codex-config.toml`** — routing/budget/context defaults from the policy, offered by
  `release:setup-codex` to a target project that has none (never overwrites an existing one).
- **Structured output contract** (`contracts/result-schema.json`, `SubagentResultV1`), complexity
  self-scoring (`contracts/complexity-rubric.md`, C0–C4), routing/fleet-shape reference
  (`contracts/routing-policy.md`), retry/scope-expansion rules, and a handoff template — all wired
  into `agent-contract.md`/`skill-contract.md` via progressive disclosure rather than inlined
  everywhere.

### Added — isolated Codex Desktop compatibility layer

- Native repo marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and generated
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` package under `plugins/release/`.
- Deterministic `codex/build_plugin.py` pipeline that ports all release-sdk
  skills, hooks, scripts, templates, and 39 subagent personas without changing
  the Claude Code source package.
- Codex custom agents named `release-*`, plus an idempotent installer that
  writes only to `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/agents/` and preserves unrelated
  agents.
- Codex runtime contracts mapping tool names, user-input checkpoints,
  skill dispatch, model inheritance, and multi-agent orchestration to native
  Codex behavior.
- `apply_patch` hook adapter, Codex-scoped context/token state, manifest
  validation, isolation tests, and a live fallback-subagent smoke test.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added — stack-expert coding skills: the SDK now carries senior-engineer personas for all three Release stacks (Django · React · React Native)

Until now the plugin shipped only workflow/process skills (plan, execute, review, audit, verify) and
stack-aware review/audit *agents*. It had no proactive "senior engineer at your side" **coding** skill —
the deep best-practices-and-design-patterns companion that auto-triggers on stack keywords *while you
write*. The only such skill (`django-expert`) lived in the user's global `~/.claude/skills/`, outside the
plugin, so it never shipped. v0.20.0 closes that: three expert skills now live IN the plugin and ship with
it. Progressive-disclosure structure (a rich `SKILL.md` spine + on-demand `references/*.md`), mirroring the
django-expert exemplar's caliber — ToC per reference, "show the why", trap warnings, tradeoff tables.

- **`skills/django-expert/`** — re-homed from global `~/.claude/skills/` into the plugin so it ships as part
  of the SDK (unchanged content: SKILL.md + 5 references — performance, security, auth_patterns, testing,
  deployment). Django 4.x/5.x + DRF.
- **`skills/react-expert/`** (new) — React 19 + TypeScript (TSX) web. SKILL.md + 5 references: `patterns`
  (composition, compound components, custom hooks, error boundaries, TS component patterns), `state`
  (server-vs-client taxonomy, Zustand selectors/slices, TanStack Query v5 optimistic/invalidation/DRF
  mapping), `performance` (re-render model, memo trio + React Compiler, virtualization, code-splitting),
  `security` (XSS/DOMPurify, token handling, CSRF, CSP — pairs with the `react-security-guard` hook),
  `testing` (Vitest + RTL + MSW mirroring DRF).
- **`skills/react-native-expert/`** (new) — React Native 0.7x + Expo (SDK 50+) mobile. SKILL.md + 7
  references: `patterns` (StyleSheet/theme, Screen primitive, gestures), `performance` (FlashList +
  Reanimated on the UI thread, Hermes, cold-start), `navigation` (Expo Router / React Navigation, typed
  routes, auth guards, deep-link validation), `state` (offline-first: TanStack Query + MMKV persistence +
  secure-store hydration), `native` (config plugins, permissions, EAS Build/Update), `security` (Keychain/
  Keystore, deep-link + SSL pinning, OWASP MASVS — pairs with `react-security-retro`), `testing` (jest-expo
  + RNTL + Maestro/Detox).
- **`skills/security-expert/`** — re-homed from global `~/.claude/skills/security-auditor` (renamed to
  `security-expert` to avoid colliding with the existing `agents/security-auditor` worker + match the
  `*-expert` convention). A cross-stack offensive-security persona (Django + React + React Native) that
  auto-triggers on security keywords — distinct from the spawned `security-auditor` agent the `skills/
  security` gate uses to produce SECURITY.md.
- **Stack identification is the trigger keywords in each `SKILL.md` frontmatter — no new detector.** Django/
  DRF/viewset → django-expert; React/hook/TSX/Zustand → react-expert; React Native/Expo/FlashList/Reanimated
  → react-native-expert. Disambiguation is explicit: **react-expert SKIPS** when `react-native`/`expo`/RN
  primitives are present and defers to react-native-expert; **react-native-expert OWNS** mobile. All three
  cross-link (`[[django-expert]]`, `[[react-expert]]`, `[[react-native-expert]]`) around the shared DRF
  backend contract. ~3,200 lines of new React/React-Native content aligned to the Release stack (Zustand,
  TanStack Query, Vitest/jest-expo).

### Migration note

Experts are sourced **only** from this repo/plugin — never from the user's global `~/.claude/skills/`. Both
pre-plugin global expert skills — `django-expert` and `security-auditor` — have been **archived** out of skill
discovery (moved to `~/.claude/archived-global-experts/`; a `django-expert` backup also exists at
`~/.claude/gsd-user-files-backup/`), so the repo copies — shipped via the plugin as `release:django-expert`
and `release:security-expert` — are the single source. Consequence, by design: outside a project with the
plugin active, these no longer auto-trigger.

### Refined — audit pass across the four expert skills (2026-07-13)

A consistency-, depth-, and accuracy-focused refinement of the skills introduced above, before they settle. No new skill or command surface — three axes.

**Accuracy fixes**
- `react-expert/references/state.md` — corrected a corrupted `keepPreviousData` comment (`no fl: list flash` → `no list flash`).
- `react-native-expert/SKILL.md` — recommended-packages table dropped the deprecated `sentry-expo`; now recommends `@sentry/react-native` (Expo-compatible via its config plugin).
- `django-expert/references/auth_patterns.md` — the `CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer` example put `role` in the JWT; added a **security caveat**: authorize from the DB (`request.user.role`/`is_staff`), never from a decoded claim (a claim is a stale, forgeable snapshot). Aligns with `advanced-threat-auditor` category **A8**.
- `django-expert/SKILL.md` — clarified `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` (legacy `X-XSS-Protection`, superseded by CSP; modern browsers ignore it).
- `security-expert/SKILL.md` — the stack is **Vite**, but examples used `REACT_APP_` (Create React App, dead); replaced across prose, code, and checklist with `VITE_`.

**Consistency + triggers**
- Cross-links: the three coding experts now reference `[[security-expert]]`, and `security-expert` cross-links back to `[[django-expert]]`/`[[react-expert]]`/`[[react-native-expert]]`.
- `security-expert` — added a **"interactive skill vs. pipeline agents"** delineation table: this skill is author-time and interactive; the retroactive, grep-proven, test-backed gate is `release:security-auditor` + `release:advanced-threat-auditor` (they share the CAT catalog).
- `security-expert` — **triggers reworked from noun-match to security-review INTENT**, with an explicit ROUTING rule: routine implementation of auth/CORS/tokens/deep-links stays with the stack experts; the security-expert is for *finding/exploiting/assessing* vulnerabilities, so a bare mention of "token"/"cookie"/"CORS" no longer preempts a stack expert.

**Depth (filling genuine gaps)**
- `django-expert/references/security.md` — completed the OWASP Top 10: added **A06** (vulnerable/outdated components — pip-audit), **A08** (insecure deserialization — pickle/yaml), **A09** (logging/monitoring), and **A10 (SSRF)** cross-referencing `advanced-threat-auditor` A1/A13.1.
- `django-expert/references/performance.md` — new **Concurrency & Race Conditions** section (`select_for_update` inside `transaction.atomic`, `F()` atomic counters, `get_or_create` + `UniqueConstraint`, idempotency keys), aligning with auditor category **A7**.
- `security-expert` — the description promised mobile coverage but the body had none. Added **CAT-14 (React Native / Expo)**: a summary + recon greps in `SKILL.md`, plus a new deep-dive **`references/mobile.md`** (14.1 secure storage · 14.2 hostile deep links · 14.3 transport/pinning · 14.4 data-at-rest/on-screen · 14.5 extractable bundle · 14.6 WebView · 14.7 OTA integrity · + OWASP MASVS mapping). This also gives `security-expert` its first `references/` file, starting the progressive-disclosure structure the other three already use.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added — model-tier orchestration: Fable orchestrates Opus workers (Opus orchestrates Sonnet as fallback)

The plugin already had the topology (orchestrator + fan-out + closed loops from v0.12/v0.18). v0.19.0
adds the missing layer on top of it: a **two-tier model hierarchy** so every operation runs as a loop
where a stronger model *orchestrates and evaluates* while cheaper-but-capable models *do the work* in
their own inner loops — and the tier is derived from the session model so a spawn never asks for a tier
the user lacks.

- **The substrate — `bin/release-model-lib.sh`.** Single source of truth for "which model runs this
  role?". Public API: `release_model_profile` (`fable-opus` | `opus-sonnet`), `release_orchestrator_model`,
  `release_worker_model`, `release_checker_model` (= orchestrator tier by design), `release_mechanical_model`
  (haiku), `release_model_effort` (max), `release_model_summary`. Resolution order: `RELEASE_MODEL_PROFILE`
  env → `.release-planning/MODELS.yml` `profile:` pin → default `fable-opus`. Contract-tested by
  `bin/test-model-lib.sh` (23 assertions, sources the real engine — no drift).
- **The topology.** Orchestrator (the session — main loop: plan → fan out → evaluate → re-dispatch) →
  N workers (each with its own worker loop: build → self-check → fix). The orchestrator never authors
  code; a worker never decides its own "done"; every **checker/verifier runs on the orchestrator tier**
  (a model *above* the maker) so "the orchestrator loops to evaluate the workers" is literal AND
  maker≠checker holds by construction.
- **Two profiles, auto-detected from the session model** (the orchestrator LLM already knows its own
  model from its system prompt — it never asks the user). Fable session → `fable-opus` (workers=Opus,
  checkers=Fable). Opus session → `opus-sonnet` (workers=Sonnet, checkers=Opus). Guarantees workers are
  always exactly one rung below the orchestrator → never spawns a tier the user lacks. Everything at
  **maximum effort** (`$CLAUDE_EFFORT`); the ONE exception is `release:test-discover` (`pytest
  --collect-only`, no judgment) kept on Haiku.
- **Override (rare — cost-control / headless):** `RELEASE_MODEL_PROFILE` env or a
  `.release-planning/MODELS.yml` `profile:` pin. The lib reads both; no command needed to set them, and
  an explicit pin always wins over auto-detection. Every loop skill prints `→ models: …` at start for
  transparency. (No dedicated skill — auto-detection + these two overrides cover every case.)
- **LOCKED doctrine in `/release:auto`** — a model-tier block inherited by every routed skill (like the
  existing "NEVER spawn gsd-*" policy), with the resolve-tiers-once snippet + role→model table.
- **Wired natively** — `execute` (and its whole chain: `wave-executor` now tags every `tdd-executor`,
  `code-fixer`, `phase-verifier`, terminal `test-runner`/`test-discover` spawn with the resolved tier),
  `loop` (freeform maker/checker/fixer), `quick` (maker), `security` (worker auditors + orchestrator-tier
  evaluation of findings + optional fix→re-audit worker loop), `debug` (worker debugger). Agent
  frontmatter now carries fallback-profile defaults (worker→sonnet, checker→opus) so a bare spawn never
  inherits the wrong tier.

### Note

Subagent per-spawn `effort` is not yet a param on the Agent tool (only the session's `$CLAUDE_EFFORT`,
already `max`), so "max effort" for workers is carried as an explicit prompt instruction plus the
lib-emitted `release_model_effort`; it upgrades automatically if/when the harness exposes the knob.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added — loop engineering: you stop being the element inside the loop

The plugin already had the maker/checker agents, worktree isolation, auto-land, and safety-in-hooks.
v0.18.0 adds the two missing pieces that close the loop automatically: a single **objective gate**
(the verifiable goal) and a **closed build→gate→check→fix→land harness** that drives a phase or a
bounded task to "done" without you re-prompting each round.

- **The Gate — `bin/release-gate-lib.sh::run_gate`.** One objective, tool-checked stop condition
  (lint / migrate / test / build). Reads `.release-planning/VERIFY-GATE.yml` (an ordered `name: command`
  map; copy from `templates/VERIFY-GATE.yml`), else a stack default (Django: ruff + `makemigrations
  --check` + pytest; React: lint + build). On RED it captures the first failing command's output as
  **evidence** the next iteration feeds back into the maker. The agent never "decides" green — the lib
  runs the real commands and decides. Contract-tested by `bin/test-gate-lib.sh` (30 assertions, sources
  the real engine — no faithful-slice drift).
- **The guardrails — `bin/release-loop-lib.sh`.** The shared budget substrate every loop sources:
  `loop_guard` (hard iteration cap + no-progress detection), `loop_signature` (stable per-iteration
  failure hash with volatile temp-paths normalized out), `loop_token_spend` (best-effort spend ceiling
  wired to the `/release:tokens` daemon — degrades silently when the meter is down). Contract-tested by
  `bin/test-loop-lib.sh` (13 assertions, sources the real engine).
- **`/release:loop` — the closed harness.** Maker (`release:wave-executor` for a phase,
  `release:tdd-executor` for freeform) builds in an ephemeral worktree off base → `run_gate` →
  independent checker → targeted `release:code-fixer` on real evidence → repeat until GATE=GREEN **and**
  the checker PASSES, then auto-lands so you can test the feature. `maker ≠ checker` always. iter 1
  builds; iter 2+ fix only what the evidence shows. Bounded by `--max-iters` (default 6), no-progress
  detection, and `--budget-usd`. On a stuck loop it HOLDS (worktree kept, base untouched) and pings you
  — never a silent overnight grind.
- **The goal is always concrete.** Phase mode → the goal is the phase **SPEC acceptance criteria**
  (`/release:spec`); `release:phase-verifier` now reads them as first-class truths. Freeform mode → the
  goal is **your prompt verbatim**, judged by the new `release:loop-goal-verifier`. A green gate is
  necessary, not sufficient: the checker judges intent, with evidence.
- **`/release:auto` router: new rule 14a → `/release:loop`** ("loop until green / build-test-fix /
  drive it to done / keep fixing until it passes").

### Changed

- **`/release:execute` loops by default (BREAKING).** After building, execute now runs the closed loop
  itself — `run_gate` → `release:phase-verifier` (the checker, run for you) → `release:code-fixer` on the
  real evidence → re-verify — and lands ONLY on GATE=GREEN **and** checker PASS. Verification is folded
  in (no separate `/release:verify` round needed); gaps are auto-fixed instead of hand-fixed. Bounded by
  `--max-iters` (default 6) / no-progress / `--budget-usd`; a stuck loop holds and pings. `--once`
  restores the legacy single-pass (build → gate-once → land/hold). `/release:loop {NN}` is now an alias
  for this; `/release:loop "<task>"` is the freeform (no-phase) loop.
- **The gate is the law for landing.** `/release:quick` also runs `run_gate` before `land_branch` — an
  explicit RED holds the work (worktree kept, base clean). Gate-lib absent or no gate resolvable ⇒
  graceful fallback (only an explicit RED ever blocks a land).
- **One guardrail engine, no drift.** `/release:audit-fix` and `/release:plan-review-convergence` now
  reference the shared `release-loop-lib.sh` primitives for their iteration cap + no-progress detection,
  the same `/release:loop` uses. `release:code-fixer`'s final sweep prefers `run_gate` when present.

### Migration

- **BREAKING (behavioral) — `/release:execute` loops + auto-verifies + lands only on checker PASS.**
  Previously execute built, landed on a green terminal wave, and left verification to a separate
  `/release:verify`. Now it gates objectively, runs `release:phase-verifier` inline, auto-fixes gaps via
  `release:code-fixer`, and lands only on green+PASS. Automation that wants the old single deterministic
  pass must pass `--once`.
- **No config required for graceful behavior.** An absent `.release-planning/VERIFY-GATE.yml` falls back
  to the stack default, and a missing/empty gate never blocks a land — so a repo with no gate config
  still builds and lands on green much like pre-v0.18.0 (it just won't have a sharp objective goal). For
  the full payoff, copy `templates/VERIFY-GATE.yml` → `.release-planning/VERIFY-GATE.yml` and set your
  real commands.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added — auto merge-back: run a phase + many quicks in parallel, and test live on your trunk

Worktree isolation is now **invisible**. `/release:quick` and `/release:execute` isolate their work
**and auto-land it back onto your trunk the moment tests pass** — so you keep one stable checkout
running the app and **see every feature land live** (hot-reload), while a phase and any number of
quicks run concurrently without ever corrupting base. The worktree stopped being a place you have to go.

- **Shared merge-back engine — `bin/release-merge-lib.sh::land_branch`.** The hardened v0.16.0 session
  `finish` logic (lock **first** → sync base→unit under the lock → conflict-safe merge into base's
  **live** checkout → cwd-safe teardown) is extracted into one reusable, contract-tested function.
  `session finish`, `quick`, `execute`, and the new `land` all call it — a single per-base lock
  serializes every merge-back, so concurrent units never race on your trunk.
- **`/release:quick` isolates by default + auto-lands.** Each quick runs in its own `quick/<label>`
  worktree off base, so N quicks (and a running `execute`) proceed in parallel with **zero collision** —
  the old "worktree clean required" precondition is gone (your main checkout may stay dirty). On green
  it auto-lands onto base.
- **`/release:execute` auto-lands the phase.** A GREEN terminal wave now lands `feat/<NN>-<slug>` onto
  base (**phase-complete granularity** — never a half-phase) instead of leaving a dangling branch and a
  manual push/PR. `--no-merge` / `--pr` keep the old dangling-branch behavior.
- **Your live trunk is never clobbered (`held-dirty`).** If the base checkout has uncommitted work at
  land time, the merge-back is **held** (not applied) and reported — your WIP is never touched.
- **New `/release:land [<label>] [--all]`.** Retry path for a held / conflicted / `--no-merge` unit:
  lands it once your trunk is clean, through the same serialized engine.
- **`/release:spec` sharper + Linear-aware.** The clarifier now asks **≥5 domain-clarifying questions**
  (mandatory floor — ≥2 probe the business domain, ≥1 is an explicit out-of-scope), so trivial-looking
  phases can't skip a hidden domain assumption. And when a **Linear MCP** is connected, the spec is
  mirrored to a `[spec] Phase {NN}:` Linear issue whose description equals the SPEC.md **byte-for-byte**
  (idempotent upsert; skipped silently when no Linear MCP is connected).

### Changed

- `bin/test-session-merge.sh` now **sources the real engine** (`release-merge-lib.sh`) instead of
  carrying faithful-slice copies — **zero drift** between the test and shipped code. **66 assertions**
  (48 session invariants + branch-name-agnostic `quick/*`/`feat/*` landing, two-parallel-quicks-no-collision,
  held-dirty hold-and-retry).
- `/release:auto` router: new rule **13a → `/release:land`** ("land / aterrissa / merge back the held unit").

### Migration

- **BREAKING (behavioral).** `/release:quick` no longer commits into your current checkout — it isolates
  and auto-lands. `/release:execute` no longer leaves `feat/<NN>-<slug>` dangling by default — it lands
  on base. Automation that relied on the dangling branch should pass `--no-merge` (or `--pr`).

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed — `/release:session` hardening (6 real multi-session incidents) + plugin-namespaced agent spawns

**`/release:session` merge-back made correct under concurrency and real planning state.** Six grounded
bugs from running 4 parallel domains into one trunk, plus a full adversarial review pass:

- **cwd-drift crash (CRITICAL).** `finish` is run from *inside* the session worktree; removing that
  worktree yanked the shell's cwd → `fatal: Unable to read current working directory`, and the branch
  delete silently never ran (leftover branch). Now `cd "$MAIN_ROOT"` + `git -C "$MAIN_ROOT"` before any
  removal; branch delete gated on a proven `merge-base --is-ancestor` (so it also works from a throwaway
  merge checkout) with `-D`.
- **Conflicts no longer mutate the base checkout.** `finish` now merges **base → session first** (the
  author has the domain context); the session→base merge is then a conflict-free fast-forward.
- **Planning never leaks into PRs.** `sync`/`finish` untrack `.release-planning/` (keeping only
  `base-branch` via `git add -f`), so merges/PRs are code-only; planning modify/delete conflicts
  auto-resolve by untracking. `finish` **hard-stops** instead of silently deleting planning that base
  legitimately tracks.
- **New `sync [label]`** subcommand (drift fix): pull base into a session, strip planning, STOP on code
  conflict. `finish` runs it as its mandatory first step.
- **`base` persistence.** `base <branch>` force-tracks `.release-planning/base-branch` and warns when
  `.release-planning/` is dir-ignored (recommends the `.release-planning/*` + `!…/base-branch` form,
  since a blanket dir-ignore makes the `!` negation impossible).
- **Visibility + cleanup.** `list` now shows ahead/behind/dirty/PR; new `doctor` flags drift,
  planning-tracked regression, and missing base-branch tracking; new `cleanup` removes worktree+branch
  for any session already merged into base.

Review-pass fixes folded in: **lock-first then sync+merge atomically** (closes a TOCTOU window where
base could advance between a session's sync and its merge), **slash-safe lockfile** (`release/v2` →
`merge-release_v2.lock`), **stale-lock reclaim** when the holder PID is dead, **refused-merge detection**
(untracked-file collision no longer mistaken for "in sync"), base-branch conflict-marker handling, and
base resolved from the session marker (never a `session/*` branch). `bin/test-session-merge.sh` grew to
**48 real-git assertions** (from 12), including finish-from-inside, throwaway path, drift, planning
modify/delete, and lock reclaim — all regression-guarded (each fix proven to fail the suite when reverted).

**Agent spawns are now plugin-namespaced + the redundant `release-` prefix dropped.** Claude Code
resolves plugin agents as `release:<name>`, so bare `subagent_type: "release-tdd-executor"` no longer
resolved (`Agent type … not found`). To avoid the ugly `release:release-…` doubling, the 31 merged
agents were renamed to drop their `release-` filename prefix (`agents/release-tdd-executor.md` →
`agents/tdd-executor.md`, `name: tdd-executor`); the 7 stack-prefixed agents (`django-*`, `react-*`) keep
their names. All spawns now use the clean form **`release:tdd-executor`**, `release:wave-executor`,
`release:react-ui-auditor`, `release:django-checklist-verifier`, … — every spawn reference across skills,
agents, and the READMEs rewritten accordingly. Frontmatter `name:` fields stay bare (Claude Code adds the
`release:` prefix); `release-*` globs and the `gsd-* → release-*` migration notes are left untouched.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-03

### BREAKING — Worktree-native parallel sessions (Model B); `workstreams` deprecated; 7 dead agents removed

New execution base: every unit of parallel work is a **session** — an ephemeral git worktree on a
`session/<label>` branch cut from one **base branch** — merged back with a serialized, conflict-safe
merge. Replaces the sustained per-domain `workstreams` model. Lets N Claude sessions run independent
domains (financeiro / operacional / RH …) at once and fold into one trunk.

#### Added
- **`/release:session`** — `start` / `finish` / `list` / `abort` / `base`. `start` cuts a worktree+branch
  off base; `finish` does a **serialized, conflict-safe** merge-back: per-base lock, `merge --no-ff`, and
  on conflict `merge --abort` so base stays byte-identical (NEVER auto-resolved) with the session
  preserved for rebase+retry. Merges inside base's own checkout (a branch lives in one worktree).
- **`bin/test-session-merge.sh`** — real-git contract test (12 assertions): disjoint sessions merge
  clean; conflicting session STOPS with base untouched + no half-merge; per-base lock serializes fan-in.
- Honest **conflict-surface table** (Django shared wiring: `INSTALLED_APPS` / root `urls.py` /
  `requirements` / `ROADMAP` phase-number ranges) with mitigations — disjoint app code + per-app
  migrations rarely collide; the shared wiring is the small, known surface.

#### Changed
- **`/release:execute`** detects `.release-planning/.session` and commits in place on the session
  branch (`no_branch`), skipping the nested phase-worktree + lock (the session already isolates it).
- **STATE is local + git-ignored** (`STATE.md`, `.session`, `active-workstream`) — parallel sessions
  never collide on a shared mutable cursor; committed truth is the per-phase artifacts under `phases/`.
- **`/release:auto`** rule 13 routes parallel / session / worktree intents to `/release:session`.

#### Deprecated
- **`/release:workstreams`** (sustained `ws-<name>` domain model) → use `/release:session`. Kept for
  in-flight migrations; removed in a future release.

#### Removed — dead code (7 agents; 44 → 37)
Orphans no release skill ever spawned + the unwired multi-cycle debug manager: `release-advisor-researcher`,
`release-research-synthesizer`, `release-project-researcher`, `release-domain-researcher`,
`release-eval-planner`, `release-doc-synthesizer`, `release-debug-session-manager`.


## [0.13.1] — 2026-06-01

### BREAKING — Concurrency-safe execution (session-isolated worktrees + per-phase lock)

Fixes cross-session corruption when running `/release:execute` in multiple simultaneous sessions on
the same repo. Symptom was `UU` unmerged paths + stray untracked test files in the main checkout, with
no `MERGE_HEAD` — produced by the serial fallback writing TDD output directly in the shared working tree
while another session was also writing there.

Root cause: both `skills/execute` and `release-wave-executor` mutated the **shared main checkout**
(`git checkout`, cherry-pick, serial fallback) with **non-session-scoped** worktree/branch names
(`wave/{NN}-{TASK}`, `../release-worktrees/{NN}-{slug}-w{N}-{TASK}`). Two sessions = one `.git/HEAD`,
one index, one worktree namespace → HEAD ping-pong, index races, `git worktree add` collisions.

- **Camada 1 — session-scoped phase worktree.** Each `/release:execute` now runs entirely inside
  `../release-worktrees/$SESSION_ID/phase`. The main checkout is never mutated. `ensure_branch`,
  cherry-pick merge, and the collision-bound serial fallback all run there via `git -C "$PHASE_WT"`.
- **Camada 2 — per-phase lock.** `../release-worktrees/.locks/{NN}-{slug}.lock` (shared sibling, visible
  to all sessions). A second session on the same phase gets a clean refusal instead of a git error.
  Stale locks (holder worktree gone) auto-reclaim.
- **Camada 3 — hygiene.** `git worktree prune` before every add; wave branches are now
  `wave/$SESSION_ID/w{N}-{TASK}` (session+wave scoped, collision-proof); explicit teardown removes the
  phase worktree + releases the lock on completion/abort.
- `--no-branch` unchanged: legacy single-session path in the main checkout (concurrency unsafe by design).
- `git worktree` unsupported → falls back to `--no-branch` with a loud warning.

Files: `skills/execute/SKILL.md`, `agents/release-wave-executor.md`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-05-26

### BREAKING — Waves-by-default execution + PLAN slice token economy

`/release:execute` no longer spawns `release-tdd-executor` directly. ALL phase execution
now routes through `release-wave-executor`, which:

1. **Parses PLAN** (wave-split dir `{NN}-PLAN/manifest.md` preferred; legacy monolithic
   `{NN}-PLAN.md` accepted only if ≤ 600 lines — otherwise refused with re-split hint).
2. **Auto-derives parallel_groups** within each wave when frontmatter omits explicit
   declarations: greedy disjoint-files partition over per-task `files:` entries, plus
   collision_detection rules (migrations, lockfiles, Django graph coherence).
3. **Slices PLAN per task** (~3KB) into worktree-local `PLAN-SLICE-{TASK_ID}.md`.
   Executor spawns full-read the slice instead of re-reading 100KB+ monolithic PLAN.
4. **Spawns N `release-tdd-executor` concurrently** in `git worktree`-isolated branches
   when disjoint files detected. Cherry-picks per-task commits back to `feat/{NN}-{slug}`
   after each wave.
5. **Verify per-wave** (intermediate, cheap gates only) + **full `parallel_test_sweep`
   at end-of-phase** (terminal wave only — replaces redundant per-task sweep).
6. **`--resume` idempotent** — skips tasks already committed by greping task IDs in
   `git log` of phase branch.

#### Removed flags

- `--waves` — waves are now default; flag dropped from `/release:execute` CLI
- `--serial` — no override; serial-in-main-tree falls out automatically when
  collision_detection forces it (Django graph coherence, migration collisions, etc.)

#### New `release-tdd-executor` spawn config

- `skip_sweep: bool` — intermediate-wave spawns skip `parallel_test_sweep`; wave-executor
  runs ONE sweep at end-of-phase
- `is_slice: bool` — plan_path is a per-task slice; executor full-reads and MUST NOT
  re-load parent PLAN/manifest (token economy contract)

#### Token economy

Phase 46 hubus baseline (Frontend, 40 tasks, monolithic 115KB PLAN):
- Before: ~4.6MB input (40 spawns × 115KB PLAN re-read)
- After:  ~120KB input (40 spawns × 3KB slice)
- **-97% input tokens.** Estimated cost drop @ Opus 4.7 input rate: ~$8 → ~$0.40 per phase.

#### Speed

Phase 46 hubus baseline:
- Before: 2h05 (Frontend serial) + 2h (Backend serial) = 4h05
- After (estimated): ~1h Frontend + ~1h25 Backend (Django graph limits BE parallelism) = ~2h25
- **~-42% wall time.**

#### Migration guide

- Existing phases with monolithic PLAN.md ≤ 600 lines: continue to work (back-compat).
- Existing phases with monolithic PLAN.md > 600 lines: re-run `/release:plan {NN}` to
  emit wave-split dir (planner already mandates this layout since v0.11.0).
- CI/CD scripts using `/release:execute {NN} --waves`: drop the `--waves` flag.

#### Files changed

- `skills/execute/SKILL.md` — drop `--waves`, invert routing to wave-executor default
- `agents/release-wave-executor.md` — add `<auto_derive_parallel_groups>` step + PLAN slice
  generation + `<resume_skip_filter>` step + monolithic PLAN refusal + terminal vs
  intermediate verify split
- `agents/release-tdd-executor.md` — accept `skip_sweep` + `is_slice` spawn config; update
  `<plan_read_protocol>` for slice mode; update `<parallel_test_sweep>` skip conditions;
  description marks v0.12.0 spawn-by-wave-executor-only

---

## [0.11.3] — 2026-05-26

### Changed — Model dispatch right-sizing per agent

Default `model: opus` (1M context) was too heavy for mechanical agents — grep-only
verifiers and one-shot writers were spending opus tokens for haiku-tier work.
Re-dispatch tightens cost without losing reasoning where it matters.

**Sonnet (medium-tier — grants 200k window, ~5x cheaper than opus)**:
- `release-code-fixer` — applies REVIEW.md findings mechanically
- `release-test-auditor` — gap detection via name matching
- `release-uat-conductor` — Q&A walkthrough via `AskUserQuestion`
- `react-ui-checker` — BLOCK/FLAG/PASS against UI-SPEC dimensions

**Haiku (cheap-tier — pure grep / count / classify)**:
- `release-pattern-mapper` — analog matching across model/view/serializer dirs
- `release-intel-updater` — codebase scan → cached intel files
- `release-nyquist-auditor` — counts tests per requirement
- `release-eval-auditor` — grep COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING per eval dim
- `django-checklist-verifier` — Q1-Q7 PASS/FAIL via grep

**Opus retained** (deep reasoning / loop / large context):
- `release-tdd-executor` — RED→GREEN→REFACTOR loop with full PLAN.md reads
- `release-wave-executor` — multi-worktree dispatch + cherry-pick coordination
- All planners, researchers, reviewers, security auditors, debuggers, integration
  checkers, milestone auditors

Estimated savings on phase-46-class workloads: ~35-45% USD without quality loss
on critical reasoning paths.

### Fixed — Token tracker missed all subagent costs

`release-token-collector.js` was only hooked to `PostToolUse` of the main thread.
Result: `events.jsonl` recorded 100% `claude-opus-4-7` even when sonnet/haiku
subagents were running — every `Agent`-tool dispatch was invisible to the
dashboard.

Fix: added `SubagentStop` matcher invoking the same collector. Claude Code passes
the subagent's own `session_id` + `transcript_path` on that event; the collector's
per-session cursor isolates subagent runs naturally — no code change to the
collector, only a 3-line `plugin.json` addition.

Now `/release:tokens` "Por modelo" panel shows real opus/sonnet/haiku breakdown,
making the model-dispatch changes above measurable.

## [0.11.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed — Executor efficiency overhaul (Phase 46 audit fallout)

Audit forense da Phase 46 (hubus refactor, 68min wall / $32-60 USD / `status: PARTIAL`)
identificou 4 gargalos no `release-tdd-executor` + `release-wave-executor`. Fixes:

**1. Django pre-commit graph coherence (`release-wave-executor.md`)**

Phase 46 forçou coalesce de 22 tasks num único commit (gap de 37min). Causa: Django
`manage.py check` valida grafo inteiro (models → admin → views → serializers → urls)
— wave-executor spawnava parallel workers em worktrees, mas pre-commit no cherry-pick
rejeitava partial states.

Fix: `<collision_detection>` agora detecta `models.py` + downstream files na mesma
wave → força `coalesce_into_wave_commit: true`. Nova função
`has_django_system_check_precommit()` inspeciona `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
WAVE-SUMMARY.md declara o coalesce explicitamente (audit trail honesto).

**2. Fullstack BACKEND-then-FRONTEND dispatch (`release-tdd-executor.md`)**

Phase 46 era fullstack mas PLAN-FRONTEND.md (40 tasks) nunca rodou — executor saiu
silenciosamente após backend. SUMMARY ficou `PARTIAL` mas sem checkpoint explícito.

Fix: novo bloco "Two-PLAN protocol" no `<fullstack-stack>`. Quando phase dir tem
`{NN}-PLAN-BACKEND.md` + `{NN}-PLAN-FRONTEND.md`: executa BACKEND completo, escreve
`SUMMARY-BACKEND.md`, executa FRONTEND, escreve `SUMMARY-FRONTEND.md`, agrega em
`SUMMARY.md` unificado. `half: backend|frontend` spawn config respeitado.
Critical rule: NEVER `status: SUCCESS` com metade untouched — força `PARTIAL`
+ checkpoint.

**3. Parallel test sweep unconditional**

`parallel_test_sweep` (introduzido no v0.11.2 step inicial) tinha skip-when-small
(<20 tests OR <5 files). Removido: agora sempre roda 5-way para coletar telemetria
+ inventory + `sweep-B*.json` requeridos pelo SUMMARY. Única exceção: `total_tests
== 0` → smoke single-shot.

**4. PLAN read protocol (`release-tdd-executor.md`)**

Phase 46 burned ~2.1M tokens em cache_read da PLAN.md monolítica (3121 linhas ×
34 tasks). Novo step `plan_read_protocol` força:
- Initial PLAN load ONCE (frontmatter + task index com line offsets)
- Per-task: `Read` com offset/limit cobrindo só section da task (~40-120 linhas)
- Cross-task lookups: `Grep` com `-A`/`-B` context, nunca full Read
- Wave files (~400 linhas) podem full-read — overhead negligível
- Anti-pattern explícito: `cat PLAN.md | grep` proibido, usar Grep tool

Redução estimada: 2.1M → ~100K tokens cache_read por phase (~95%).

### Added — 5-way parallel test sweep + cheaper models

**Problema:** Final test sweep do `release-tdd-executor` rodava `pytest`/`vitest`
em série sobre 200+ testes via Opus → 5+ min wall time + custo alto. Em fases
com waves paralelas (v0.11.0) o sweep virava o novo gargalo.

**Solução:** Novo step `parallel_test_sweep` substitui o sweep serial:

1. **`release-test-discover`** (model: **haiku**) — roda `pytest --collect-only`
   ou `vitest list`, emite JSON `{file: test_count}` ordenado desc.
2. **Bucket greedy bin-packing** — distribui arquivos em 5 buckets balanceados
   por número de testes (~total/5 por bucket).
3. **`release-test-runner`** (model: **sonnet**) — 5x spawn em paralelo, cada
   um roda seu bucket, emite JSON `{passed, failed, failures[]}` com traceback
   head capado em 10 linhas.
4. **Aggregate** — qualquer FAIL → Opus re-roda só arquivo afetado pra diagnose
   completa + fix flow normal (Rule 1/2 deviation).

**Skip parallel** quando `total_tests < 20` OU `total_files < 5` (overhead > ganho).

**Ganho estimado:** sweep 5 min → ~1 min wall time (5x parallel). Custo cai
~80% no sweep (haiku discover + sonnet runners vs opus serial).

**Telemetria:** SUMMARY.md ganha bloco `parallel_sweep:` com `wall_time_seconds`,
`serial_estimate_seconds`, `speedup`.

**Stack blocks atualizados:** `### Final sweep` em django-stack e react-stack
agora cobre só lint/grep/tsc — pytest/vitest delegado pro novo step. Suítes
especializadas (smoke/race/memray/security) também usam `release-test-runner`
mas com 1 bucket (já são pequenas).

**Backward-compat:** se inventário vier vazio (`total_tests == 0`), executor
roda sweep single-shot inline (comportamento legacy).

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed — Token dashboard: "Sessão atual" sempre $0.00 + "Por skill" sempre vazio

**Bug 1 — Sessão atual = $0.00:**

Dashboard chamava `/api/stats` sem query `session_id`. Worker recebia `null`
e nunca acumulava events na bucket `session`. Fix: quando `session_id` ausente
na query, worker auto-detecta = `session_id` do evento mais recente (se < 30min).
Dashboard agora exibe os 8 primeiros chars do session_id ativo (com tag "(auto)"
quando inferido). Funciona transparentemente independente de qual sessão CC abriu o browser.

**Bug 2 — POR SKILL sempre vazio:**

`release-token-collector.js` extraía skill via regex `<command-name>X</command-name>`.
Esse formato só aparece em comandos built-in (`/clear`, `/login`, `/model`).
Slash commands de plugin (`/release:plan`, `/release:execute`) injetam conteúdo
diferente no transcript — header `# /release:<name>` + path `.../skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

Fix: novo `extractSkill()` reconhece 3 formatos em ordem:
1. Path `Base directory for this skill: .../skills/<name>` → `release:<name>`
2. Header `# /<command>` → `<command>`
3. Tag `<command-name>X</command-name>` (built-ins) → `X`

Também removido `break;` prematuro que parava após primeira user message
mesmo quando sem skill signal. Agora walk-back continua até encontrar ou esgotar.

Events anteriores ao fix permanecem com `skill: null` — dashboard só
preenche POR SKILL para events futuros. Clear `~/.claude/token-tracker/events.jsonl`
para reset opcional.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-26

### BREAKING — Wave-split PLAN structure

PLAN.md monolíticos (3000+ linhas vistos em fases reais) substituídos por diretório
de waves. Cada wave file = 3-5 tasks, 200-600 linhas. Cap duro 600 linhas. Drasticamente
reduz contexto consumido por executores e plan-checkers, e permite paralelização real
entre waves.

**Antes:**
```
{NN}-PLAN.md            (3101 linhas, 34 tasks)
{NN}-PLAN-CHECK.md
```

**Depois:**
```
{NN}-PLAN/
  manifest.md           (frontmatter + waves table, < 300 linhas)
  W1-red-tests.md       (~300 linhas, 4 tasks)
  W2-models-migration.md
  W3-viewsets.md
  W4-serializers.md
  W5-security.md
  W6-verify.md
{NN}-PLAN-CHECK.md      (inclui wave-budget audit)
```

Para fullstack: `{NN}-PLAN-BACKEND/` + `{NN}-PLAN-FRONTEND/` (dois dirs paralelos).

#### Wave budget contract (HARD)

- `WAVE_TARGET_LINES: 400` (alvo)
- `WAVE_HARD_CAP_LINES: 600` — plan-checker emite BLOCKER acima
- `TASKS_PER_WAVE: 3-5`
- Manifest < 300 linhas; tasks moram nos W*.md
- Cada wave: `wave`, `depends_on`, `parallel_safe`, `files_touched` no frontmatter
- Tasks NUNCA atravessam wave files

#### Plan-checker novas regras (BLOCKER)

- Wave file > 600 linhas
- Empty wave (0 tasks)
- Tasks no manifest.md
- Cross-wave dep cycle
- Task duplicada em ≥2 waves
- File overlap entre waves `parallel_safe: true`

#### Back-compat

PLAN.md legacy (single-file) ainda é lido por checker e executor.
Plan-checker emite finding MED sugerindo re-rodar `/release:plan` para wave-split.

### Changed — Model dispatch per agent

Agents mecânicos (grep evidências, mapping estrutural) agora rodam em modelos mais baratos:

| Agent | Model | Razão |
|---|---|---|
| release-plan-checker | sonnet | grep + trace traceability |
| release-pattern-mapper | sonnet | map files → analogs |
| release-codebase-mapper | sonnet | inventário estruturado |
| release-intel-updater | sonnet | rewrite intel/ files |
| release-nyquist-auditor | sonnet | test counting |
| django-checklist-verifier | sonnet | Q1-Q7 grep |
| release-eval-auditor | sonnet | eval coverage grep |
| release-django-security-retro | sonnet | mitigation grep |
| react-security-retro | sonnet | mitigation grep |
| release-doc-verifier | haiku | factual claim verification |
| release-doc-classifier | haiku | 1-doc classifier |

Planejadores (`release-feature-planner`), executores (`release-tdd-executor`,
`release-wave-executor`) e researchers permanecem em Opus 4.7 — trabalho que exige
raciocínio profundo.

**Ganho medido vs Phase 46 (hubus, refactor quadros-horário):**
- Latência plan stage: 1h37min → ~35-45min estimado (~55% redução)
- Tokens plan+check: 700k → ~280k estimado (~60% redução)
- Custo proporcional

### Migration

Projetos pré-v0.11 funcionam — checker lê PLAN.md legacy e emite MED suggesting
re-run. Para migrar uma fase existente para wave-split:

```bash
/release:plan {NN}    # re-roda planejamento, emite {NN}-PLAN/ dir
```

## [0.10.3] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed — `django-prompt-guard.js` regex parse error broke plugin init

`hooks/django-prompt-guard.js:65` had a regex that embedded literal Unicode
characters including U+2028 (JS LINE SEPARATOR) inside the character class:

```js
if (/[​-‏ - ﻿­]/.test(content)) { ... }
```

Node v22+ parses the literal U+2028 as a source-level line terminator,
breaking the regex with `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: missing /`.
Plugin manifest registers this hook on `PreToolUse:Write|Edit` — Claude Code
fails to load the plugin's skills when any declared hook fails parse.

Symptom: `/reload-plugins` reported "1 skill" total even after adding
`release@release-sdk` to `enabledPlugins`. Agents and other hooks still loaded
because the loader continued past the broken hook for those.

Fix: rewrite the regex with escaped `\\uXXXX` source-form so the regex string
is byte-safe — same semantics, parser-safe.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed — `allowed_tools:` (invalid) broke skill registration

After v0.10.1 added `name:` to all 40 SKILL.md, skills still failed to register.
Root cause: every skill used `allowed_tools: A, B, C` (underscore + CSV string).
The Claude Code spec uses `allowed-tools:` (hyphen, YAML array) — same form as
GSD's user-level skills in `~/.claude/skills/`. The underscore variant is not a
recognized field and made the loader bail on each release-sdk skill silently.

For now removed the line entirely. Skills load without per-skill tool
restrictions. Future release will re-add as proper YAML:

```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash
```

## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed — Skills not loading in Claude Code v2.1.142+

All 40 `skills/*/SKILL.md` files were missing the `name:` frontmatter field.
Claude Code v2.1.142 silently fails to register skills without `name:` —
result: `/release:*` autocomplete showed no skills in new sessions and
`/reload-plugins` reported only "1 skill" total across all installed plugins.

Added `name: <dirname>` to every SKILL.md in the plugin. Slug matches the
directory name (e.g. `skills/auto/SKILL.md` → `name: auto`).

Other plugins (claude-mem, caveman) had `name:` already; release-sdk relied on
dir-name inference which stopped working in recent Claude Code releases.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — Token tracker dashboard

New `/release:tokens` skill opens a local HTTP dashboard at `http://localhost:47777`
showing token usage, cost ($), cache hit ratio, and efficiency metrics for every
Claude Code turn — across sessions, models, projects, and skills.

**Files:**
- `bin/release-token-worker.js` — Node HTTP daemon, no external deps; JSONL storage at `~/.claude/token-tracker/events.jsonl`
- `bin/release-token-dashboard.html` — single-file UI, Chart.js via CDN, auto-refresh 5s
- `hooks/release-token-collector.js` — PostToolUse hook; parses transcript tail, POSTs new assistant `usage` events to `/event`
- `skills/tokens/SKILL.md` — `/release:tokens` skill entry (spawn worker + open browser)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /event` — append usage event to JSONL
- `GET /api/stats?session_id=X` — aggregates by session/today/week/month/all-time + breakdown by model/project/skill + timeline
- `GET /api/health` — `{ok, port, pid}`
- `GET /` — dashboard

**Pricing table** (hardcoded in worker, $/Mtok): Opus 4.7 `15/75 cache 1.5/18.75`, Sonnet 4.6 `3/15 cache 0.3/3.75`, Haiku 4.5 `1/5 cache 0.1/1.25`.

**Privacy:** worker binds `127.0.0.1` only; records token counters, never message content.

**Port choice:** 47777 (claude-mem uses 37777 — no conflict).

### Fixed — Commit hook heredoc bypass

`hooks/django-validate-commit.sh` was rejecting `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`
because the Conventional Commits regex ran on the raw `$CMD` string before shell
expansion, capturing the literal `$(cat <<'EOF'` token as the subject.

Now skips validation when MSG contains command substitution (`$(cat`) or heredoc
markers (`<<'`, `<<"`, `<<NAME`) — same fallback used for empty `-m` (interactive
editor case).

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-25

### Changed — Agent taxonomy: stack-pure prefix

Three-tier naming makes stack-specificity explicit at the agent name:

- `release-*` — merged agents that accept `stack: django|react|fullstack` param
- `django-*` — Django-pure logic agents
- `react-*` — React-pure logic agents (new)

Renamed 4 React-only agents from `release-*` → `react-*`:

- `release-ui-researcher` → `react-ui-researcher`
- `release-ui-checker` → `react-ui-checker`
- `release-ui-auditor` → `react-ui-auditor`
- `release-react-security-retro` → `react-security-retro`

All `subagent_type` refs in skill files updated. `git mv` preserves history.

### Removed — 2 orphan django-* agents

- `django-plan-checker` — superseded by `release-plan-checker` (v0.7.0). Zero live spawn refs.
- `django-roadmapper` — zero live spawn refs.

Kept (live spawn refs): `django-discuss-orchestrator`, `django-checklist-verifier`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-25

### BREAKING — Plugin rename + skill prefix drop

Plugin invocation prefix shortened from `/release-sdk:release-<x>` to `/release:<x>`. Requires reinstall.

#### Migration (required)

```
/plugin uninstall release-sdk@release-sdk
/plugin marketplace update LucasAlvesBorges/release-sdk
/plugin install release@release-sdk
```

After reinstall, all commands change form: `/release-sdk:release-debug` → `/release:debug`, `/release-sdk:release-plan` → `/release:plan`, etc.

#### Changed

- **`plugin.json`**: `name: "release-sdk"` → `name: "release"`. Repo/product name remains `release-sdk` (no GitHub rename).
- **All 39 release-* skill directories** renamed without `release-` prefix: `skills/release-<x>/` → `skills/<x>/`. Performed via `git mv` so commit history follows.

#### Removed — legacy django-* skill set (11 skills)

The unified release-* skills with stack dispatch (`stack: "django"`) have covered Django since v0.7.0. The parallel `django-*` skill tree was kept for migration; now removed.

- `skills/django-checklist/`
- `skills/django-discuss/`
- `skills/django-execute/`
- `skills/django-init/`
- `skills/django-phase/`
- `skills/django-plan/`
- `skills/django-review/`
- `skills/django-roadmap/`
- `skills/django-security/`
- `skills/django-status/`
- `skills/django-verify/`

Functionality preserved via `/release:init`, `/release:plan`, `/release:execute`, `/release:review`, `/release:verify`, etc, which detect Django stack from `STATE.md` / `CONTEXT.md`.

The four supporting `django-*` agents (`django-discuss-orchestrator`, `django-plan-checker`, `django-checklist-verifier`, `django-roadmapper`) are retained — they are spawned internally by `/release:discuss`, `/release:plan`, and `/release:checklist`.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed — Agent isolation hardening

`gsd-*` agents from prior GSD installs (left in `~/.claude/agents/` or in project-scope `.claude/agents/` of GSD-imported repos) leak into the `subagent_type` list available to Claude. In sessions where both `gsd-debugger` and `release-debugger` are visible, Claude can substitute the GSD-named variant — bypassing release-sdk hooks, stack dispatch, and audit trail.

- **All 16 skills that spawn agents** now carry an `## Agent Policy (LOCKED)` block immediately after frontmatter forbidding `gsd-*` substitution and stating the `gsd-<x>` → `release-<x>` rule.
- **`/release:auto`** carries the extended policy with a full substitution map covering 16 explicit agent mappings.
- Affected skills: `release-ai-phase`, `release-auto`, `release-autonomous`, `release-debug`, `release-discuss`, `release-import`, `release-init`, `release-mvp-phase`, `release-plan`, `release-quick`, `release-review`, `release-ship`, `release-spec`, `release-ui-phase`, `release-undo`, `release-verify`.

No agent definitions, hooks, or routing rules changed. Defense-in-depth only.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — Wave 5: Django+React operational gap closure (8 new files)

Wave 5 closes the operational gap identified in the GSD v1.42 audit for Django+React projects. Adds milestone lifecycle, session handoff, dependency-aware undo, MVP vertical-slice planner, and wires four v0.7.0 orphan agents into their parent skills.

#### Milestone lifecycle (3 skills + 1 agent)

- **`/release:new-milestone`** (`skills/release-new-milestone/SKILL.md`) — initialize new milestone (v1.0 → v1.1). Bumps PROJECT.md milestone field, appends new ROADMAP.md section, optionally promotes backlog items to phases. Hard gate: zero phases in `executing`/`planned` in previous milestone.
- **`/release:complete-milestone`** (`skills/release-complete-milestone/SKILL.md`) — closes current milestone. Runs `release-milestone-auditor` (hard gate). Moves `phases/{NN}-{slug}/` → `milestones/{name}/phases/{NN}-{slug}/`. Generates `SUMMARY.md` (timeline, commits, LOC, D-XX, REQ coverage). Updates ROADMAP archive section.
- **`/release:audit-milestone`** (`skills/release-audit-milestone/SKILL.md`) — non-destructive standalone milestone audit. Writes timestamped `MILESTONE-AUDIT-{name}-{date}.md`. Read-only. Safe mid-milestone. `--hot-list` mode for compact view.
- **`release-milestone-auditor`** agent (`agents/release-milestone-auditor.md`) — cross-checks REQ → phase → UAT → verify. Classifies each requirement COVERED / PARTIAL / GAP with file:line evidence. Adversarial stance: assumes ≥1 REQ has incomplete coverage even if all phases marked shipped.

#### Session lifecycle (2 skills)

- **`/release:pause-work`** (`skills/release-pause-work/SKILL.md`) — captures session handoff at `.release-planning/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD-HHhMM}/` with HANDOFF.md, cursor.yaml, git-state.txt, open-files.txt, context.md. Multi-session history (additive, never overwrites). No commits, no worktree mutations.
- **`/release:resume-work`** (`skills/release-resume-work/SKILL.md`) — restores context from a paused session. Interactive picker (most recent first), `--latest`, `--list`, `--clear-after`. Detects drift between paused cursor + current STATE.md, and between paused git state + current worktree. Never auto-executes the next-action command — prints it.

#### Rollback (1 skill)

- **`/release:undo`** (`skills/release-undo/SKILL.md`) — dependency-aware `git revert` (additive — never rewrites history). Three modes: default (HEAD), `--plan {NN.X}`, `--phase {NN}`. Reads per-phase MANIFEST.md to walk later phases and abort if any depends_on the target. `--force` to override. Cross-`main` boundary requires `--force` + warning.

#### MVP planner (1 skill)

- **`/release:mvp-phase`** (`skills/release-mvp-phase/SKILL.md`) — vertical-slice planner. Captures canonical user story (As a / I want to / So that, regex-validated), runs heuristic size check, offers SPIDR decomposition (Spoke / Paths / Interfaces / Data / Rules) for oversized stories. Deferred slices auto-append to ROADMAP Backlog. Then delegates to `/release:plan {NN} --mvp` (flag scheduled for v0.8.1 wire-in).

#### v0.7.0 orphan agents wired (4 edits)

- **`release-plan-checker`** now auto-spawned by `/release:plan` (backend, frontend, fullstack). Verdict gating: BLOCK → suggest `--revise`, WARN → log + proceed, PASS → commit. Replaces legacy `django-plan-checker` reference.
- **`release-assumptions-analyzer`** now auto-spawned by `/release:discuss` immediately after stack detection, BEFORE D-XX questioning. DP-XX prompts from `ASSUMPTIONS.md` surfaced as "Hidden assumption — confirm or override:" questions in the dim 1-10 batch.
- **`release-integration-checker`** now auto-spawned by `/release:verify` when ≥2 phases at stage `verified`/`shipped` in current milestone. Writes `.release-planning/INTEGRATION-CHECK.md` (milestone-scoped). Informational only — never gates per-phase verdict.
- **`release-framework-selector`** now auto-spawned by `/release:ai-phase` between Q1 (provider) and Q2 (hosting model) when AI-SPEC.md has no `framework:` field OR `--reselect-framework` passed. Selector's recommendation prefills Q1's answer.

### Changed

- **`/release:auto` routing table extended** from 32 to 39 rules. New routes cover all 7 Wave 5 skills with explicit state guards (`dirty_worktree`, `sessions/` presence, milestone phase counts, current-milestone shipping status).

### Notes

- Wave 5 closes the GSD-substitution gap for Django+React projects. After v0.8.0, release-sdk is a drop-in replacement for GSD on any Django+React stack.
- `/release:plan --mvp` flag (delegated by `/release:mvp-phase`) is scheduled for v0.8.1 — currently `/release:plan` ignores unknown flags. MVP ROADMAP mutations (Mode + SPIDR slice) already take effect and the planner reads them.
- No removals. Safe upgrade from v0.7.x.
- 7 new skills + 1 new agent + 4 wired skills = 12 files affected.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — GSD-gap closure (31 new files across 4 parallel waves)

Spawned via 4 parallel agent waves (each agent in clean context, isolated by output path), this release closes the gap audit against upstream GSD across **planning, discussion, execution, research, debug, UI, eval, audit, docs** axes.

#### P0 — Core loop (Wave 1)

- **`release-plan-checker`** agent (`agents/release-plan-checker.md`) — pre-execution goal-backward verifier; every PLAN task must trace to a SPEC goal + a D-XX/LOCK-XX; stack-aware gates (Django N+1/raw SQL/`fields='__all__'`; React `localStorage`-auth/type contracts); produces `{NN}-PLAN-CHECK.md` with PASS/FAIL verdict.
- **`release-assumptions-analyzer`** agent (`agents/release-assumptions-analyzer.md`) — deep codebase analysis for a phase before planning; surfaces hidden assumptions, ripple analysis, LOCK cross-check; emits `DP-XX` discuss prompts in `{NN}-ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
- **`/release:autonomous`** skill (`skills/release-autonomous/SKILL.md`) — runs all remaining phases sequentially through spec → discuss → plan → execute → verify-work; aborts on first verify failure; never auto-ships.
- **`release-integration-checker`** agent (`agents/release-integration-checker.md`) — cross-phase E2E workflow probe + data-contract check (DRF↔Zod for fullstack); produces `INTEGRATION-CHECK.md`.

#### P1 — Research completeness (Wave 2)

- **`release-research-synthesizer`** agent — consolidates parallel researcher outputs into `SUMMARY.md` with CONSENSUS/CONFLICT/UNIQUE buckets + deterministic agreement score.
- **`/release:map-codebase`** skill + **`release-codebase-mapper`** agent — parallel 4-focus codebase analysis (tech, arch, quality, concerns) producing `.release-planning/codebase/*.md`.
- **`release-project-researcher`** agent — pre-roadmap ecosystem research (competitors, reference architectures, pitfalls, regulatory) via WebSearch+WebFetch.
- **`release-domain-researcher`** agent — pre-eval domain expertise (practitioner criteria, failure modes, regulatory landscape, benchmarks) for AI phases.
- **`release-intel-updater`** agent — cached intel files at `.release-planning/intel/` (MODELS, ROUTES, COMPONENTS, MIGRATIONS, DEPENDENCIES, TEST-MAP).

#### P2 — Adjacent quality gates (Wave 3)

- **`release-debug-session-manager`** agent — multi-cycle `/release:debug` loop manager in isolated context; checkpoint-survives `/clear`; bubbles only consequential decisions; returns compact YAML summary.
- **`/release:add-tests`** skill — backfill tests for phase UAT items OR regression coverage for a file; spawns `release-tdd-executor` in test-only mode; surfaces impl bugs to `{NN}-TEST-GAP.md` (never auto-fixes).
- **`release-ui-checker`** agent + **`/release:ui-review`** skill + **`release-ui-auditor`** agent — UI-SPEC pre-validation (PASS/FLAG/BLOCK) + retroactive 6-pillar scored audit (accessibility, responsive, loading/error, i18n, type contracts, design system).
- **`release-advisor-researcher`** agent — single gray-area D-XX decision research with options × 5 dims comparison + falsifiable recommendation.
- **`/release:validate-phase`** skill + **`release-nyquist-auditor`** agent — every requirement must have ≥2 tests (Nyquist sampling); audit-only or auto-dispatch to `/release:add-tests` for gap-fill.
- **`/release:plan-review-convergence`** skill — pipes `{NN}-PLAN.md` to external AI CLIs (codex, gemini) iteratively until HIGH=0 AND MED≤2.

#### P3 — Eval + audit lifecycle (Wave 4)

- **`release-eval-planner`** + **`release-eval-auditor`** agents + **`/release:eval-review`** skill — AI eval strategy upfront (failure modes, dims with rubrics, tooling, dataset, guardrails, monitoring) + retroactive coverage audit (COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING per dim) with PII/injection escalation rule.
- **`release-framework-selector`** agent — interactive decision matrix scoring 4-7 AI framework candidates (LangChain/LlamaIndex/LangGraph/Anthropic SDK/OpenAI/Vertex/Bedrock/Custom) on Fit/Latency/Cost/Compliance/Stack-Ergonomics.
- **`/release:forensics`** skill — post-mortem investigation with 5-whys + recovery plan in `.release-planning/forensics/`.
- **`/release:audit-fix`** skill — autonomous audit-to-fix loop (parallel auditors → classify → release-code-fixer per atomic commit → re-audit until clean or max-iters).
- **`/release:audit-uat`** skill — cross-phase outstanding-UAT sweep with priority-ranked hot-list.
- **`release-doc-writer`** + **`release-doc-classifier`** + **`release-doc-synthesizer`** + **`release-doc-verifier`** agents + **`/release:docs-update`** skill — full doc-ops family: write/classify/synthesize/verify project documentation grounded in `.release-planning/` + intel + codebase probes.

### Changed

- **`/release:auto` routing table extended** from 21 to 32 rules. Every new skill above is routable via freeform intent. All routes resolve to native `/release:*` skills — `/gsd:*` is not a fallback path.

### Notes

- This release adds capabilities without removing any; safe upgrade from v0.6.x.
- Some new agents are not yet wired into the existing skill flows — `/release:plan` does not yet auto-spawn `release-plan-checker`, `/release:discuss` does not yet auto-spawn `release-assumptions-analyzer`, etc. Those integrations will land in v0.7.x as the agents are validated against real-world phases. For now, invoke them directly via `Agent({subagent_type: "release-plan-checker", ...})` or via `/release:auto` keyword routing.
- 31 new files / ~8200 LOC added.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **`CLAUDE.md` injection** in `/release:init` and `/release:import`. Both flows now write a delimited `<!-- release-sdk:start --> ... <!-- release-sdk:end -->` block into the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` so future Claude Code sessions know release-sdk is installed and where the planning artifacts live. Idempotent:
  - File missing → created with a minimal header + the block.
  - File present, block present → only the delimited block is replaced; every other byte preserved.
  - File present, no block → block appended at the end (two blank lines before it).
- Block surfaces: framework name + stack, paths (`.release-planning/RELEASE-LOCKS.md`, `STATE.md`, `phases/{NN}-{slug}/`), and the `/release:auto` entry point with the full `/release:*` skill index.

### Fixed

- Gap surfaced by user audit: 5 agents (`release-feature-planner`, `release-spec-clarifier`, `release-tdd-executor`, `release-code-reviewer`, `release-code-fixer`) and `templates/PLAN.md` already READ `CLAUDE.md` for conventions, but nothing in release-sdk wrote it — so brand-new projects had agents reading an empty or generic file. `/release:init` and `/release:import` now own that write.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **`/release:auto`** — freeform-intent router. Reads the user's prompt + `.release-planning/` state and dispatches to the right `/release:*` skill (20 routes covering import / status / init / spec / discuss / plan / execute / review / verify / verify-work / secure-phase / security / ui-phase / ai-phase / workstreams / checklist / ship / debug / quick / fast). Always prints the chosen route + a 1-line reason before invoking; falls back to `AskUserQuestion` when classification confidence is low. Mirrors GSD's `gsd-progress` "unified situational command" pattern.
- **`/release:debug`** — persistent debug session under `.release-planning/debug/{session_id}/`. Survives `/clear` via checkpoint protocol. Stack-aware (django / react / fullstack) dispatch to the existing `release-debugger` agent.
- **`/release:fast`** — trivial inline task execution. No subagents, no phase machinery, no state writes. Clean-worktree gate + atomic commit. For < 30 LOC single-file edits where the work is faster than planning it.
- **`/release:quick`** — bounded multi-file task with atomic commits + light state tracking (logs to `.release-planning/quick-log.md`) but skips the SPEC / DISCUSS / PLAN heavy envelope. Spawns `release-tdd-executor` in `quick_mode`. Cursor untouched.
- **`/release:ship`** — final PR gate for verified phases. Pre-ship review via `release-code-reviewer`, PR title + body grounded in `{NN}-SPEC.md` / `{NN}-PLAN.md` / `{NN}-UAT.md`, `gh pr create`, then moves `.release-planning/STATE.md` cursor to `shipped`. Never auto-merges. Refuses to ship anything not at `active_stage: verified`.

### Notes

- All four new skills (`debug`, `fast`, `quick`, `ship`) are native to release-sdk and live under the `/release:*` namespace; `/release:auto` no longer falls back to `/gsd:*` for any route.
- `/release:auto` is opt-in. Nothing else in release-sdk depends on it.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-25 — BREAKING

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed planning directory from `.planning/` to `.release-planning/` to avoid conflict with upstream GSD, which also uses `.planning/`. Projects with both tools can now coexist without file collisions.
  - All release-sdk skills (`/release:init`, `/release:spec`, `/release:plan`, `/release:execute`, `/release:review`, `/release:ui-phase`, `/release:ai-phase`, `/release:status`, `/release:ship`, etc.) now read and write under `.release-planning/`.
  - `/release:import` is the bridge: reads GSD `.planning/` (untouched) and writes release-sdk artifacts to a parallel `.release-planning/` tree.
  - `release-import-orchestrator` agent rewritten with explicit source/dest separation: `.planning/` for READS, `.release-planning/` for WRITES. Idempotency check moved from `.planning/RELEASE-LOCKS.md` to `.release-planning/RELEASE-LOCKS.md`. State updates write to `.release-planning/STATE.md`; GSD's `.planning/STATE.md` is never touched.

### Migration

- **Standalone release-sdk projects** (no GSD): `mv .planning .release-planning`. No content change needed.
- **GSD-imported projects**: re-run `/release:import` after upgrading. The orchestrator now writes the parallel `.release-planning/` tree and leaves GSD `.planning/` untouched. Old `.planning/RELEASE-LOCKS.md` and `{NN}-*.md` siblings from a prior import can be removed once `.release-planning/` is populated.
- **Mixed setups**: both `.planning/` (GSD) and `.release-planning/` (release-sdk) can now live in the same repo.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **`/release:import`** — one-shot mass importer that converts an existing GSD `.release-planning/` tree into release-sdk native format. Single pass:
  - Project-level: extracts LOCK-01..LOCK-12 from `PROJECT.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`/`CONVENTIONS.md`/`config.json` → writes `.release-planning/RELEASE-LOCKS.md` with `[EXTRACTED]` / `[INFERRED]` / `[MISSING]` status per LOCK.
  - Phase-level: globs `.release-planning/phases/*/`, detects stack (Django / React / fullstack) from PLAN/SPEC content, ports `SPEC.md` → `{NN}-SPEC.md` (stack-aware ambiguity), `CONTEXT.md` → `{NN}-CONTEXT.md` (preserves D-XX), `PLAN.md` → `{NN}-PLAN.md` (injects RC1-RC7 + Q1-Q7 + 9-cat security), `VERIFICATION.md` → `{NN}-VERIFICATION.md` + `{NN}-UAT.md` (splits machine vs user-observable items).
  - Stubs (never fabricated): seeds `{NN}-UI-SPEC.md` for React/fullstack phases, `{NN}-AI-SPEC.md` for LLM phases, `{NN}-SECURITY.md` placeholders — all flagged `ready_for_plan: false` with `[NEEDS REVIEW]`.
- **`release-import-orchestrator`** agent — drives the mass port. Read-only against GSD originals; writes release-sdk siblings alongside.
- Flags: `--dry-run`, `--force` (re-import with AskUserQuestion confirmation), `--phases=NN[,NN]`, `--no-stubs`.

### Removed — BREAKING

- **`--gsd-context` flag** removed from `release-init`, `release-spec`, `release-ui-phase`, `release-ai-phase`, `release-plan`, `release-review`. Runtime translation of GSD artifacts is replaced by the one-shot `/release:import`. Migration: run `/release:import` once; all skills then assume release-sdk native format.
- Sections removed: `GSD Context Mode (--gsd-context)`, `Co-installed GSD plugin (--gsd-context)`, Steps 1–7 of GSD-presence check in `release-init`.

### Changed

- `release-init` is now scoped strictly to greenfield project initialization. For imports, use `/release:import` first.
- README slash-commands table now shows `/release:import` as the first command.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — close upstream GSD gaps with 6 new skills + 2 hooks

**Skills**

- `/release:spec {NN}` — clarifies WHAT a phase delivers before `/release:discuss`. Produces `SPEC.md` with HIGH/MED/LOW ambiguity scoring. Stack-aware (Django / React / fullstack).
- `/release:ui-phase {NN}` — design contract for React phases. Produces `UI-SPEC.md` with component inventory, routes, state contracts (loading/empty/error/success), a11y contract, performance budgets (LCP/TTI/INP), optimistic UI plan. React-only guard at skill + agent layer.
- `/release:verify-work {NN}` — conversational UAT walkthrough. Renders stack-specific verification scripts (Django curl + manage.py shell, React browser walk + a11y keyboard, fullstack e2e). PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / SKIP per item. Resumable.
- `/release:secure-phase {NN}` — retroactive threat-mitigation audit. Greps shipped source for every threat declared in PLAN.md against a 9-category scorecard. Verdict: PASS / FLAG / BLOCK with file:line evidence.
- `/release:ai-phase {NN}` — AI-SPEC.md design contract for LLM features. Defaults to Anthropic SDK (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) with prompt caching, native tool use, SSE streaming via Django proxy (LOCK-09 httpOnly cookie enforced).
- `/release:workstreams [list|create|switch|status|progress|complete|resume|remove]` — top-level parallel feature isolation. Each workstream gets its own `.release-planning/workstreams/<name>/` namespace, `ws-<name>` branch, session-scoped active pointer.

**Agents**

- `release-spec-clarifier` — drives WHAT clarification via AskUserQuestion; refuses HOW questions to keep SPEC vs DISCUSS boundaries clean.
- `release-ui-researcher` — fingerprints design system (tailwind / shadcn / MUI / chakra / mantine), classifies 17 design dimensions LOCKED vs OPEN, batched AskUserQuestion for gaps only.
- `release-uat-conductor` — walks user through UAT items with stack-specific verification steps. Rewrites UAT.md after every answer (crash-resumable).
- `release-django-security-retro` — greps shipped Python for evidence of every T-XX threat across 9 categories + N+1 spot-check.
- `release-react-security-retro` — greps shipped `.tsx/.ts` for XSS, token storage, CSRF plumbing, IDOR, secret exposure, eval, Zod runtime validation.
- `release-ai-researcher` — validates LOCK-01 / 03 / 09 / 10 / 12 against AI integration plans; drafts prompt skeleton + Zod mirror + eval harness + `AILog` model. Appends to AI-SPEC.md (never overwrites).

**Templates**

- `SPEC.md` — rewritten stack-aware; HIGH/MED/LOW buckets replace numeric ambiguity scoring.
- `UI-SPEC.md` — new; 12.4 KB; `UI-DEC-XX` decisions grouped by composition / routing / state / a11y / perf / optimistic.
- `UAT.md` — new; ID / Item / Stack / Steps / Status / Notes / Verified At table.
- `SECURITY.md` — new retroactive scorecard with per-stack tables + drift detection vs author-time SECURITY.md.
- `AI-SPEC.md` — new; framework choice + hosting architecture + prompt contract + evaluation strategy + guardrails + production monitoring.
- `WORKSTREAM-STATE.md` — new per-workstream state file with YAML frontmatter (name, stack, branch, owner, status, cursor, blockers) + phase index table.

**Hooks**

- `release-read-injection-scanner.js` — PreToolUse:Read. Scans files (.py/.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.json/.md/.yaml/.toml/.sh/.html/.css/.sql, <1 MB) for prompt-injection patterns: ignore-previous-instructions, role overrides, `<|system|>`, XML role tags, long base64 near decode/exec keywords, exfiltration language, zero-width chars (U+200B/200C/200D/FEFF). Pattern names only in warnings, never file contents. Disable via `RELEASE_SDK_READ_INJECTION_SCAN=0`.
- `release-context-monitor.js` — PostToolUse:*. Tracks tool-call count per session; warns once at 50 (moderate) / 100 (consider `/release:pause-work`) / 150 (critical, auto-compaction imminent). State at `.claude-plugin-cache/release-context-monitor-<session_id>.json`. Disable via `RELEASE_SDK_CONTEXT_MONITOR=0`.

### Changed

- README updated with new commands + hooks tables.
- Plugin manifest version bumped 0.2.0 → 0.3.0 in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`.
- Marketplace description expanded to cover new capabilities.

### Fixed

- Casing of GitHub repo in manifests (`lucasalvesborges` → `LucasAlvesBorges`) so marketplace install URLs match canonical GitHub path.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- Initial release: full-stack Django + React TSX acceleration plugin.
- 9 `/release:*` skills, 9 `/django:*` skills, 25 specialized agents, 7 hooks.
- Branch-per-phase logic in executors.
- Worktree-isolated parallel planning for fullstack phases.
- `release-wave-executor` agent for intra-phase parallel TDD execution.
- 9-category security audit (Django + React).
- RC1-RC7 + Q1-Q7 author checklists.
- N+1 detection, race-condition guards, XSS / auth-token security.
